            "body": "Starting on July 25th, we began getting submissions from a new gaming news site. And I use the term \"gaming\" in multiple senses of the word, here. Right now, a full 17% of the posts here in the past few days are from LegitGamer. 29% are from YouTube (direct links to trailers, which I consider to be a \"primary\" source). Even the big sites like RPS and Joystiq are only around 9%-10%. For a small and brand new site, it sure is popular.\n\nOr is it? Without calling out names, there are at least four people who submit from LegitGamer and pretty much _only_ from LegitGamer. And most of their comments are on LG submissions. I have to assume they're voting on each other's content to game our community. We've been in contact with at least one of these accounts asking them to tone it down. That was ~~a few weeks ago~~ 10 days ago. The number of submissions from the one account may have gone down, but there have been more accounts submitting heavily from that site, bringing the total number up. \n\nAt the same time, we began getting a few complaints about the number of submissions from that site. They were few, but they were there. However, in the past 24 hours, we'e gotten five complaints from worried readers like yourself , one even going as far to say he was afraid we might be turning into /r/gamingnews or even /r/legitgamer. I assure you, this is not true.\n\nIs LegitGamer banned from /r/gamernews? No. **But I do ask this**. If you see a post, _any post_, that is just a link to another site with the original source, **report it**. This goes for every site. I don't care if it's LegitGamer or if it's Joystiq or if it's the New York Times. From here on out, we will _not_ tolerate blogspam of any kind. It's in our rules, but we'e been sort of lax because of the difficulties in reading and verifying every link that's posted. No more. If the linked post adds nothing of value to the source material, report it. It will disappear. \n\n**What this means to our submitters**. When you go to post a link, check the sources. Compare them. If nothing of value is added, _post the original_. We're not trying to pick on any site, we're trying to increase the value of the posts for our readers. As you know, if you do not follow the clearly stated rules, we will not hesitate to remove the post and provide feedback on how you could resubmit a better link.\n\nAs usual, if you have questions/concerns/feedback/criticisms, please leave a comment or message the mods. We're always open to suggestions.\n\n**edit - sorry, I said we messaged the person in question a few weeks ago. It was actually 10 days ago. Minor correction, but for honesty's sake, I figured I should have gotten it right.",

            "body": "Hello everybody!\n\nWe in the moderating team wanted to bring you this quick update.\n\n**Pageview Milestone**\n\nFirst off, last month we hit 1 million pageviews. Yay us! /r/gamernews is steadily increasing in readership, and shows no sign of slowing down. You've all made this a popular place to be!\n\nReddit recently made traffic reports available to everyone. You should be able to view our traffic reports here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/about/traffic/\n\n**Rule Changes**\n\nWe recently discovered (With the excellent help of the admins) votegaming being employed in /r/gamernews. Votegaming is a method of using alt. accounts in a coordinated manner to upvote some submissions and downvote competing submissions. Most, if not all, of these efforts were aimed at increasing the popularity of certain unofficial Youtube channels.\n\nOur original stance was that any video content (Trailers, developer walkthroughs etc.) didn't need to come from the official channels (That of the developers or publishers), because those videos are often sent out in press releases which give implicit permission to upload the videos anywhere the poster wants.\n\nThe simplest way for us to address and police this votegaming abuse is a rule change: **From now on all video submissions must point to the official channels** (For example, if it is a Youtube video of a new Call of Duty game, the submission must point to the video on the official Activision Youtube channel).\n\nIn the rare cases where no official channel/source exists for videos (e.g. If a video was only sent out in a press release), submissions which link to unofficial channels are acceptable. However, we DO have the ability to check whether an official video was uploaded before an unofficial video was.\n\nIf you are a reader of /r/gamernews, you will likely not notice the change - you will be watching the same trailers, and everything will work as it already has.\n\nIf you submit to /r/gamernews, simply search on Youtube or other video sites for the officially uploaded video, and submit that, rather than uploading the copy sent to you in a press release or other communication.\n\nWe would also like to remind you that our rules don't allow embedding official video content on an unofficial web page and submitting that, unless sufficient value is added (e.g. A transcript of a video interview would add sufficient value).\n\n**Last, but not least**\n\nThis community wouldn't be what it is if it weren't for all of you! Thank you.\n\nDon't forget: If you'd like to see more of a certain type of content here, submit it! Become the change you want to see in /r/gamernews!\n\nLastly, [here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/mBJ5yqy.jpg) of an adorable duckling courtesy of /r/aww.\n\nIf you have any questions, constructive criticism, or concerns, please let us know in the comments below. We'll be addressing (hopefully!) all of it.",

            "body": "I am about halfway through Bill Nye Saves the World, and I am completely disappointed. I've been a huge fan of Bill Bye since I was ten. Bill Nye the Science Guy was entertaining and educational. Bill Nye Saves the World is neither. In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side. To make things worse he does this in the most boring way possible in front of crowd that honestly seems retarded. He doesn't properly explain anything, and he misrepresents every opposing view.\n\nI just finished watching the fad diet episode. He presents Paleo as \"only eating meat\" which is not even close to what Paleo is. Paleo is about eating nutrient rich food, and avoiding processed food, grains and sugar. It is protein heavy, but is definitely not all protein. He laughs that cavemen died young, but forgets to mention that they had very low markers of cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because \"nobody wants it.\" Really? That's his go to argument? There was no discussion about handling nuclear waste, or the nuclear disaster in Japan. A panelist states that the main problem with nuclear energy is the long time it takes to build a nuclear plant (because of all the red tape). So we have a major issue (climate change caused by burning hydrocarbons), and a potential solution (nuclear energy), but we are going to dismiss it because people don't want it and because of the policies in place by our government. Meanwhile, any problems with clean energy are simply challenges that need to be addressed, and we need to change policy to help support clean energy and we need to change public opinion on it.\n\nIn the alternative medicine episode he dismisses a vinegar based alternative medicine because it doesn't reduce the acidity level of a solution. He dismiss the fact that vinegar has been used to treat upset stomach for a long time. How does vinegar treat an upset stomach? Does it actually work, or is it a placebo affect? Does it work in some cases, and not in others? If it does anything, does it just treat a symptom, or does it fix the root cause? I don't know the answer to any of these questions because he just dismissed it as wrong and only showed me that it doesn't change the pH level of an acidic solution. Also, there are many foods that are believed to help prevent diseases like fish (for heart health), high fiber breads (for colon cancer), and citrus fruits (for scurvy). A healthy diet and exercise will help prevent cardiovascular disease, and will help reduce your blood pressure among other benefits. So obviously there is some reasoning behind some alternative medicine and practices and to dismiss it all as a whole is stupid.\n\nI just don't see the point of this show. It's just a big circle jerk. It's not going to convince anyone that they're wrong, and it's definitely not going to entertain anyone. It's basically just a very poor copy of Penn and Teller's BS! show, just with all intelligent thought removed.",

            "body": "#**Adult Swim** (join us in /r/adultswim!)\n\n***\n\n15 years ago today, Cartoon Network gave three hours in the middle of the night to an experiment called Adult Swim.\n \nFor the last 10 years in a row, the network has ranked No. 1 among adults 18-34 years old in basic-cable ratings across the total day. The median age of the Adult Swim viewer is 24 years old, about half that of viewers across all broadcast and cable channels.\n \nIt saved Family Guy and is responsible for making Seth MacFarlane a TV powerhouse with three shows, three movies, a nine figure net worth, and a relationship with Emilia Clarke. (not a good thing to everyone)\n \nIt saved Futurama.\n \nIt turned Tim and Eric from two weirdos who were mailing unsolicited DVD\u2019s to Bob Odenkirk to comedy superstars with a multimedia and multichannel entertainment kingdom with two movies and thirteen television shows, including Nathan for You, Comedy Bang! Bang!, Review, W/ Bob & David, and Check it Out! With Dr. Steve Brule, which stars an Academy Award nominated actor.\n \nIt boosted the careers of Killer Mike, Flying Lotus, Odd Future, MF Doom, Danger Mouse, and completely made the career of MC Chris. It introduced Killer Mike and El-P, who went on to form Run the Jewels.\n \nIt gave Brendon Small a platform to launch his multimedia Metalocalypse franchise of a show, albums, and even live tours.\n \nIt caused a terrorism scare that cost the head of Cartoon Network his job.\n[(See my Aqua Teen retrospective here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/3i4f7h/after_14_years_11_seasons_137_episodes_a_movie/)\n\n#####Let\u2019s set the scene\n \nIt's September 2, 2001. The animated adult comedy landscape is nascent but sparsely populated, and you still (barely) live in an innocent, pre-9/11 world.\n \nMission Hill has been off the air for 1 year, Space Ghost and Dr. Katz for 2 years, and Beavis and Butt-Head and Duckman for 4 years.  (The Critic has been off for 6 but who cares?) Home Movies only lasted five episodes before being canceled by UPN 2 years ago. The Simpsons is already arguably in decline with Oakley and Weinstein gone. Family Guy has been granted a last minute reprieve of a third season, but its likely to be canceled again as Fox continuously shifts its schedule, and would you really miss it anyway? King of the Hill is going strong, but that's kind of an acquired taste. Futurama is great, but like Family Guy, Fox is fucking with its schedule so you worry. And of course, there's South Park, but nobody wants to enjoy just 1 show forever.\n \nThe future seems bleak. South Park, the Simpsons, and Beavis and Butthead are popular. Why won\u2019t anyone else give shows like these a serious chance?\n \nYou\u2019ve heard rumors that Cartoon Network aired some really strange shows with no warning last year. You even caught a random new episode of Space Ghost over the summer! They\u2019ve experimented with weird late night stuff before, like ToonHeads and Late Night Black and White, but even that was still mainly for kids and they canceled Space Ghost in \u201999! The bastards.\n \nYou resign yourself to channel surfing when you hear [this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9CnXYQMTUw). What does it mean? What could it be for? What the hell is \u201cadult swim\u2019? (LOWERCASE INTENDED). Curious, you keep watching, and you can\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s [Home Movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Movies_(TV_series))! And it\u2019s\u2026 a new episode?!?! Enraptured, you keep watching. A show about [fast food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force)? A show about [Birdman as a lawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Birdman,_Attorney_at_Law)? A show about [an underwater research station full of insane people]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealab_2021)? [Brak got his own damn show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brak_Show)! And even [Cowboy goddamn Bebop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop)! One of the greatest anime of all time!  What the hell is going on?!?!\n \n#Beginnings\n \nIn 1993, Mike Lazzo was senior vice president of Cartoon Network, a subsidiary network of Turner that was just a year old and hoping to challenge its more established competitors, Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. The decline of cartoons on the networks due to FCC regulations and market shifts (see: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday-morning_cartoon#Decline\n)) gave an upstart like Cartoon Network a chance.\n \nEven back then at a children\u2019s focused channel like Cartoon Network, however, it was obvious animation wasn\u2019t just for adults, so Ted Turner asked Mike Lazzo, a high school dropout who\u2019d worked his way up from Turner\u2019s shipping department^[1], to create a cheap cartoon that would air late at night and appeal to adults.\n \n\u201cWhat, reasoned Lazzo, could be more low-cost than to take animation frames from the old Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning children's cartoon series Space Ghost and Dino Boy and superimpose them over newly filmed live action sequences? Going a bit farther, Lazzo decided to use the old reedited Space Ghost footage as part of a concept he'd been toying with for year: a satirical David Letterman-style talk show, with a thoroughly clueless and humorless host asking celebrity guests a steady stream of stupid, non sequitur questions. As a result, Space Ghost Coast to Coast was not only the Cartoon Network's first original cartoon series, but it was also the first animated talk show in TV history!\u201d^[2]\n \n\u201cThe original name of the show stemmed from early 1993, while Andy Merrill and Jay Edwards were coming up with names for a marathon of the original Space Ghost TV show to air on Cartoon Network, trying to find things that rhyme with \"Ghost\".\u201d^[3]\n \nSpace Ghost got 6 seasons and even a kid friendly spin off (Cartoon Planet) before being canceled, or at least put on hiatus, in 1999.\n\n***\n \n####Space Ghost family tree\t\n######Dave Willis\t\n+ Aqua Teen Hunger Force\t\n+ Squidbillies\t\n+ Sealab 2021\t\n+ Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell\t\n+ Perfect Hair Forever\t\n+ Young Person\u2019s Guide to History\t\n+ Too Many Cooks\t\n \n######Matt Maiellaro\t\n+ Aqua Teen Hunger Force\t\n+ Squidbillies\t\n+ Sealab 2021\t\n+ The Brak Show\t\n+ Perfect Hair Forever\t\n \n######Adam Reed\t\n+ Sealab 2021\t\n+ Frisky Dingo\t\n+ **ARCHER**\n \n######Matt Harrigan\n+ Late Show with David Letterman    \n+ KaBlam!   \n+ Celebrity Deathmatch\t\n+ Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law\t\n+ Perfect Hair Forever\t\n+ Tom Goes to the Mayor\t\n+ Assy McGee\t\n+ Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\t\n+ FishCenter Live\n \n***\n\n#Kickoff\n \nWhile entertaining pitches for a variety of adult-focused cartoons, Lazzo realized the potential for packaging them as a complete adult-focused block. Different names were considered, including \u201cibiso\u201d, Spanish for \u201cstop\u201d, and \u201cParental Warning\u201d, but he eventually settled on Adult Swim. Cartoon Network aired pilots for Harvey Birdman, Aqua Teen, Sealab, and Brak unannounced on different late night hours in December 2000, and aired two new episodes of Space Ghost in May and July 2001 to test the waters. After greenlighting the pilots, reviving Home Movies, and securing the rights to Cowboy Bebop, Adult Swim was born, starting off with the first new episode of Home Movies, \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut\u201d.\n \n#Family Guy\n \nFamily Guy was created by Hanna-Barbera veteran Seth MacFarlane, who\u2019d worked on several Cartoon Network shows developed by Lazzo, including Powerpuff Girls, Courage the Cowardly dog, and Dexter\u2019s Lab, as an adaptation of his thesis film for his studies at the Rhode Island School of Design.The show struggled under Fox\u2019s infamously fickle scheduling, which saddled it with low ratings. Adult Swim began reruns of the show in April 2003, and the show was canceled by Fox the same year. It immediately skyrocketed to Adult Swim\u2019s highest rated show, with ratings 239% higher on the late night network than on Fox. The ratings success, coupled with strong DVD sales, convinced Fox to renew the show for a fourth season. Family Guy has since aired 14 total seasons and numerous specials. Show creator Seth MacFarlane used the success of the show to successfully negotiate for two additional shows on Fox, American Dad, which has aired 13 seasons and which airs in reruns on Adult Swim today, and The Cleveland Show, which aired for four seasons on Fox before being canceled and also still airs in reruns on Adult Swim today.\n\n#Futurama\n\nThe brainchild of Simpsons creator and television icon Matt Groening and Simpsons writer David X. Cohen, Futurama also struggled with Fox\u2019s capricious scheduling and only lasted one more season than Family Guy before being canceled. Adult Swim picked up the show for reruns in 2003, and producers used the high ratings to convince Fox to greenlight four direct-to-DVD movies. The success of those movies convinced Comedy Central to pick up the show for a revival and reruns. Futurama went on to air 52 additional episodes on Comedy Central.\n\n#Tim and Eric\n\nTim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim met while studying at Temple University, and began producing comedy shorts shortly thereafter. In 2002, they mailed a packet containing glossy headshots, a letter, a DVD containing early versions of Tom Goes to the Mayor, and an itemized bill for all of the above to Conan O\u2019Brien, Robert Smigel, and fortuitously, Bob Odenkirk. Bob was the only who responded.^[4] From that pitch, we got one of Adult Swim\u2019s strangest shows and the beginning of perhaps the most controversial Adult Swim success stories. One look at Adult Swim\u2019s social media presence will tell you that there is perhaps no bigger demarcator in the Adult Swim fan base than feelings on Tim and Eric. A switch from the dialogue driven animated \u201cstoner\u201d comedy of the early crop of shows to the live action surreal \u201ccringe\u201d humor of Tim and Eric, which relied heavily upon video editing, is still, in my opinion, the biggest cultural inflection point in Adult Swim\u2019s history.\n\nT&E leveraged the success of TGTTM to negotiate for their next show, the most controversial Adult Swim show ever, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! which ran for 5 seasons. The show was followed by a Christmas special, a movie, a failed pilot with Gregg Turkington in his Neil Hamuburger, the Twilight Zone inspired anthology show Tim and Eric Bedtime Stories, and a direct spinoff, Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule, starring Academy Award nominated actor John C. Reilly, which just concluded its 4th season.\n\nTim and Eric are no longer just late night TV alt comedy stars, however. As their success on Adult Swim grew, so did their reach outside of the network. They\u2019ve produced shows on IFC, Comedy Central, and Netflix, including the breakout hit Nathan for You, and the Netflix revival of their comedy mentor Bob Odenkirk\u2019s show Mr. Show. Eric has built up a career as a major music video director, producing videos for Ben Folds, Beach House, Major Lazer, and more. Tim has established himself as a (semi-serious) musician, and acted in mainstream hits like the hit film Bridesmaids, The Simpsons, the Office, and more. Together with Sarah Silverman, Reggie Watts, and Michael Cera, Tim and Eric created the popular YouTube comedy channel Jash.\n\nThe Abso Lutely train shows no signs of slowing down any time soon, and the divisive reactions it incites among Adult Swim fans show no signs of abating.\n\n#Metalocalypse\n\nBrendon Small was no stranger to Adult Swim. They\u2019d been a savior to him when they\u2019d saved Home Movies from UPN obscurity and cancellation, but the show ended in 2004. During this time, he began attending metal shows with his friend Tommy Blacha, former writer for Conan, SNL\u2019s TV Funhouse, and Da Ali G Show, and the former creative director for the WWE. From these shows, the idea for Metalocalypse, originally titled Deathclock, was born. Small, a guitar geek and graduate of the Berklee College of Music, worked to ensure that the show was as faithful to real guitar playing as it was funny, carefully syncing the animation of realistic finger and hand movements to the show\u2019s music. Almost every episode featured an original metal song, and the list of guest stars soon became a Who\u2019s Who of the metal and rock worlds.\n\nDethklok wasn\u2019t just a fictional band, however. Small and Adult Swim released three full length albums and an EP as Dethklok, and even conducted full nationwide tours in \u201cGorillaz style\u201d several times, with video depictions of the animated band and a real band on stage, featuring Small and others.\n\nBut all good things must come to an end. In it\u2019s third season Metalocalypse became the first of only two Adult Swim shows ever to increase its running time from one season to the next (the other was China, IL) going from the more Adult Swim traditional time of 11 minutes up to 22. This did not last, though, and for the show\u2019s fourth season its running time was brought back down to 11 minutes. In what proved to be another one of the network\u2019s most controversial decisions ever, the fourth season would come to be the last, as Adult Swim canceled the series. Contentious negotiations followed (Small told one interviewer that he hung up on Lazzo in fury the last time they ever spoke by phone), but the show ultimately concluded its broadcast history with an hour length rock opera titled The Doomstar Requiem.\n\n***TRILL-I-AM\u2019S CONJECTURE***\n\nMike Lazzo is famously hands on with Adult Swim creators, to the point of driving the development of individual characters.\n\n\u201cHe suggested that 14-year-old Morty should show more backbone, because that\u2019s the character whose perspective the audience gets most.\nThe producers took his advice and added a new scene to the first episode in which the grandson seizes control of a space ship from a drunken Rick to prevent a catastrophic explosion. \u201cThat\u2019s how we found [the characters\u2019] relationship,\u201d says Mr. Harmon. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to let Lazzo down. Which, as a writer, is such a crazy thing to hear yourself say about a suit.\u201d\u201d\n\nSo basically, if you have a show on Adult Swim, you\u2019re not insulated from the bigwigs by layers of bureaucracy. There\u2019s just one bigwig and he\u2019s directly involved with the creative process of almost every show. So if you have a show, he better like it.\n\nFans will tell you that Mike Lazzo doesn\u2019t appreciate good art and that his cancellation of Metaltocalypse makes him worse than Hitler. I think this misses the point of why he canceled it.\nFrom bits and pieces of interviews and one-off appearances on Adult Swim streaming shows, I\u2019ve basically put together that Mike Lazzo thought the show had forgotten that Adult Swim was a comedy network, and its increasing emphasis on telling a serialized serious story involving prophecies and talking whales instead of telling jokes with music on the side meant the show was no longer suited for Adult Swim. The only other Adult Swim show that\u2019s ever attempted to tell a semi-serious serialized story, The Venture Bros., has dealt with the balance between story and comedy by staying light-hearted throughout and grounding the serious elements in a world and web of characters that\u2019s constantly being lampshaded and being put in your face as inherently less than serious. The Boondocks would make serious points (Return of the King and The Passion of Reverend Ruckus) but was balanced out by many more comedic episodes.\n\nDo you think serious storytelling has a place on Adult Swim? If your answer is yes, then you probably think Lazzo was wrong to cancel Metalocalypse. If your answer is no, it would seem that Lazzo made the right decision.\n\n#Anime\n\nIn the 90s, Toonami used hits like Dragonball Z to pave the way the normalization of anime on \nAmerican children\u2019s television. Adult Swim followed it up with the first full-throated introduction of mature action anime to American audiences. With shows like Cowboy Bebop, The Big O, and Samurai Champloo, Adult Swim blew the doors off of anime in America, exposing audiences to an entire catalog of shows that no other network would have been willing to broadcast. Even Toonami could never have aired a show Trinity Blood. Breaking even more new ground, Adult Swim has even helped finance original Western-friendly anime like Space Dandy and the upcoming second season FLCL. While anime on the network is currently limited to only one day a week, it\u2019s still a testament to Adult Swim\u2019s relative bravery in the world of television that they\u2019re willing to air a category of shows that almost no other other American television network has been willing to air in the 15 years since AS started, except for flirtations by G4 and SyFy.\n\n#Streaming\n\nAdult Swim currently has 10 different 24/7 streaming channels, only two of which require a cable or satellite subscription. They have a daily animation marathon, a daily live action marathon, a marathon of Tim and Eric, a marathon of The Venture Bros., a stream of their growing companion online channel of shows like FishCenter and Stupid Morning Bullshit, a marathon of the experimental video/music show Off the Air, a Toonami marathon, a marathon replay of the online show FishCenter Live, and an east and west coast live simulcast of the television block that requires cable or satellite. While their deal with Hulu took a great amount of content off AdultSwim.com, the amount of episodes they offer on their website for free and with unimpeded access is still completely unparalleled in the American television landscape.\n\n#infomercials/Off the Air\n\nAdult Swim is more friendly to experimental video and comedy than any other television brand or network in American history. No other network would be willing to air a show like Off the Air (albeit at 4 AM). And while hits like Too Many Cooks may briefly capture the internet\u2019s attention, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg of Adult Swim\u2019s insane and daring series of shorts known as Infomercials. There\u2019s [\u201cM.O.P.Z.\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7RyZDMRQTI) a full feature length film sped up until its only 11 minutes long. There\u2019s the disturbing [\u201cThis House Has People In It\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7RyZDMRQTI) from internet famous experimental fillmmaker Alan Resnick, complete with its own still yet to be fully resolved ARG. There\u2019s the (literally) sedate [\u201cJoe Pera Talks You To Sleep\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trfHP5LHVNY).\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nI could go on and on and on. If i\u2019d started this earlier, I would\u2019ve gone into Xavier Renegade Angel, Moral Orel, The Boondocks, and so much more.\n\nSuffice it to say, Adult Swim has changed American television and American culture. While it may not have the flashy success of the more \u201cgrown-up\u201d networks like HBO, FX, and Comedy Central, it\u2019s a sleeping giant that those very same networks are falling all over each other to learn from.  The only other TV network to ever have a strong cultural brand identity, MTV, was already arguably in decline at this point in its life. Adult Swim is still going strong as hell, and I hope it\u2019ll still be here in another 15 years. I\u2019ve given it a lot of nights in my life, and like a body pillow, it\u2019s been there for me.\n \n***\n\n######Citations\n \n^1 Cohen, Alan. \"Swimming Against The Tide.\" Fast Company.

Beyond extending the joy of painting to millions who might otherwise have never thought themselves capable, Bob taught us to believe in ourselves, in the amazing power hidden in each and every soul. He understood the value of different perspectives, and encouraged all of his viewers to embrace their own unique humanity. He recognized the importance of both tragedy and beauty in the context of life as well as nature. \n\nBeyond all this, Bob Ross was one of the kindest, gentlest spirits to ever grace our TV screens. For as long as he could, he worked to make this world a prettier place, one painting at a time. For that, I will always look up to him.\n\nHappy painting, Bob, and God bless.\n\nHere's the final episode: [season 31 episode 13](https://youtu.be/nJGCVFn57U8) \n\nEdit: Just wanna thank y'all for sharing your love and stories and making me feel good too!

It's a truly fantastic read, filled with drama, action, and an unpredictable, exciting, linear plot.  I'd imagine D.B. Weiss and David Benioff could do the story more justice than David Lynch or the sci-fi channel were able to do, especially with a fat budget from HBO. \n\nEDIT:  Wow, never thought this would reach the front page!  Glad to see other people like this idea too.  And thank you for the \"spice\" kind stranger!",

Not what some people say in political rallies, not what the narrative of some part of the U.S political discourse tells a part of the American electorate. Our relationship historically was based on suspicision, distrust, and hate at times, but like Dylan said, \"The times are a changin'\", so many Mexicans like myself, that is a child of the internet, that grew up with Mr. Rogers and Thundercats are embracing the notion of how similar we are. \n\nWe might not see eye to eye on many issues but we do care about you, we cared when Katrina hit and a battalion of Mexicans troops rushed to help and tons of supplies were raised in a nationwide effort. You cared when the deadliest earthquake hit Mexico City and you rushed to our help not to mention our interminable economic issues all the way until 1994. Mexico, despite the perception, is strong economically and is a country with great future and that's explained due to our join efforts.\n\nSo, thank you Conan. As a Mexican I felt so represented today, you raised the voices of million of us who when we view the U.S.A we view them as a friend, not as an enemy. \n\n And for that, Thank you so much.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the love, in the forms of comments ,gold, PM, etc.. It truly came from the heart. And also just heard that Conan and the staff read the letter, so that's pretty damn awesome. Thank you Conan staff for coming along and having a blast, Viva Mexico! and may God bless the United States.",

And I also tend to relate more with a show when I understand the cultural context.\n\nE: Well, this blew up for some reason. Apparently I wasn't the only one who thought about that. And TL;DR, other frequent suggestions that came up in the comments include: A-Z list of all the content, a \"play a random episode\" function, showing the expiration date of the content, adding trailers and giving users the opportunity to create personalized lists. The general consensus seems to be that none of that is ever going to be added though, so there's that.\n\nAlso, thanks to everybody who kindly told me to open my phone and look it up on IMDB. Yes, I already do that, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but I did figure that one out all on my own. The whole point of this post is that it's kind of annoying to have to do that.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the discussion guys, had fun reading your comments and suggestions. Since a lot of you were saying you wanted a random function to rewatch The Office for the ninth time, I humbly suggest the Season 7 Halloween episode if you're looking to watch an episode tonight. It's hilarious and it'll get you in Halloween mode. Gabe's Lady Gaga costume alone is worth the watch. ",

It was such a well thought out and produced show. I mean everyone has a favorite memory from the show. It's timeless and classic.

I know that if Netflix made a Stargate show, it would be amazing. \n\nYou could pick up Stargate:Universe and continue that, (its conclusion left a wonderful way to pick up right where it left off, and the second season was really quite good despite its poor start in season one.) or you could create a whole new story, and being Netflix, you'd draw a whole new audience to the Stargate universe because you have built a great reputation for launching new, quality shows.\n\nedit: so... /u/JosephMallozzi, executive producer of Stargate, just stopped by. this site amazes me. \n\nI expected this post to go nowhere, but I really care about Stargate so I figured what the hell. The support and kindred spirits that have poured in here are really incredible, and this has made my day, probably my month. Thanks to everyone. \n\nedit edit: Goo'old! unbelievable. thank you. \n\n",

Americans believe that things will get better. Brits laugh at how things stay the same. To become a hit in the United States, The Office not only had to transform the tragic, grating boss into a less tragic, less grating, more well-meaning boss; it had to cast off the message, central to the British original, that work is where you go to waste your life.\"\n\nAgree?",

But I really recommend that, despite its accessibility, you skip netflix and buy the series on DVD or some other format. One of the greatest parts about Scrubs is the music. The show has some incredibly powerful moments, and those moments are captured perfectly in the show's soundtrack. However, apparently some of the licenses expired/couldn't get renewed, and on Netflix the soundtrack has been largely replaced. The new songs are not nearly the caliber of the original soundtrack \u2014 they're often pop-y or jesus-y or just not good. If you really want to experience the show the way it was meant to be experienced, I highly recommend you find another avenue for viewing. ",

Because recently I got myself a powerchair and started getting out of the house using the Rover shuttle thing. \n\nOne of my things that tries to at least approach a normal existence is going to my barbershop and then to a starbucks around the corner. So yesterday I went to Starbucks. I got a coffee and a terribly underwhelming sandwich and sat (which is a moot point I guess since I'm always sitting) at a table to watch Netflix. I started to watch IASIP so as to give it a chance, It was in my queueueue for a while now. \n\nGuess what. I chuckled. A few times. Which is a lot more than I can say for any contemporary sitcom these days. Predictable, laugh track uninspired drivel.\n\nThis somehow seems... quirky... in a good way. I never really went for quirky things. I don't watch The New Girl or whatever the name is.\n\nBut this is funny. I chuckled a few times. Went through 2.5 episodes. Now watching at home. 7th episode. Ha! Never thought I'd like it. But there it is.\n\nEdit: well this blew the fuck up.\n\nDouble edit: this is me http://i.imgur.com/amXycRj.jpg\n\n#hashtag edit because why not: my friends list is full in steam I don't know how else to add youse guys. This blew up in ways I couldn't even imagine. Nearly 500 PMs?! Obligatory thanks for the gold, but better spent on little defenseless animals or whatever.

He feels like it's an inappropriate gift for a man to give another man, and then he gives this golden line: \"You don't understand how men work. We don't give each other presents. We pretty much ignore each other until someone scores a touch down\". And as soon as I heard that, all I could think of was Ron Swanson. Add in both of their love for being handy men, knowing how to fix things, and more traditional views on how to be a \"real man\", I just think that they would be excellent friends. \n\nWell, until they found out each other's political views, as Red is very pro government and Ron is not. Although to be fair, both shows are based in very different time periods, so maybe one of their opinions would change on the government if they were moved to the other time period. ",

So far it's given us 10 seasons, 130 episodes, [a movie that made just $5 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Zg2guCzgU), [a live action episode](http://kisscartoon.me/Cartoon/Aqua-Teen-Hunger-Force-Season-06/Episode-10-Last-Last-One-Forever-and-Ever?id=8627), [a terrorism scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Boston_bomb_scare), and [an until-recently never aired episode written in response to the aforementioned terrorism scare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtMKQqwu57I).\n\nThe entire television landscape has changed around it, culturally, commercially, and technologically, but it kept on trucking. Even Adult Swim has changed during its lifetime, introducing live-action programming and at one point even (temporarily) removing all anime all-together. It will have had 11 seasons and 140 episodes. The average number of episodes for an Adult Swim original is 25, the median's 20. The average and median number of seasons is 2.\n\nIt was never heralded as a landmark of transgressiveness like South Park, it was never bemoaned as an celebration of youthful nihilism and apathy like Beavis and Butthead, and it was sure as hell never mythologized as an icon of American entertainment and pop culture generally like The Simpsons. It was just good tv. It gave us moments like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mVwa6t_Apo), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPd7cdIf_08), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBLkLwz4Oyo).

But he used it in the context of bitching out the writers, saying they had made his character so despicable that soon his character would just be calling Troy and Shirley the n-word. \n\nAt the time, as an up-to-date watcher of the show, I mostly dismissed it, thinking \"Pierce is just the antagonist/villain, that's his role. Chevy Chase is kinda overreacting here.\"\n\nI had forgotten how different Pierce was at the beginning. He was a bit weird (just being 60 years old and a student is weird), but he was still a functioning human being and a legit member of the study group. For every oddball thing he did, he also gave some real fatherly/helpful advice to a younger member of the group. He was an actual fleshed out character. \n\nBy comparison the later seasons Pierce was an extremely 1-dimensional impish dweeb that was completely unbelievable as a person; he was a cartoonish buffoon of a villain that belonged in a crappy direct-to-DVD Uwe Boll movie or something.\n\nI'm aware of \"[Flanderization](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization)\" so I know this is nothing new to sitcoms, and I'm aware that Pierce is far from the only Community character to suffer from this, but it's a whole lot easier to see the contrast when watching an old episode.\n\nRe-watching those old episodes gave me a new appreciation for Chevy Chase's argument. I could see myself getting just as upset if I was him and saw my character devolve so much. ",

Everyone's having a great time exploring the world and role playing. Sure, there's plenty of hack and slash, but you also enjoy the slow bits. You flirt with the ladies in the brothel. An interesting character tells you the back story of his cool sword. \n\nThen, as the hour draws late, you realize that you're running out of time. The GM's mom (or wife) is giving you the stink eye because she wants you all out so she can go to bed. People start talking about how they have to work in the morning. Snack supplies are getting perilously low.\n\nSo you speed things up so you can get to the end of the adventure. Everything happens very quickly. You flit around from one place to another. Conversations are short and to the point. \n\n[spoiler](#s \"OK, we go to the Wall to catch a wight so we can show it to Cersei\")\n\n(ROLLS)\n\n[spoiler](#s \"It takes you three weeks.

We then follow his career and moral evolution as the Crown's behavior toward the colonies becomes more extreme and belligerent, including several profoundly stirring political speeches that summarize the spirit, morals, and hopes of the American Revolution.\n\nUnlike virtually all other examples of such speeches in film and TV, these are not pandering to the biases and historical ideology of the audience, but arise with credible passion from the direct experiences we see occurring to Adams.  His increasingly central role in events is not an intervention of fate, but the dearly-bought product of a man obsessed with duty and finding a way forward for his country despite being constantly under siege by his own flaws and insecurities.\n\nOnce underway, Adams' contributions to the war are primarily diplomatic, including an often humorous - sometimes (accurately) mortifying and embarrassing - sojourn to Louis XVI France in search of alliance.  His self-righteousness and unpolished forwardness play like nails on a chalkboard against the voluptuous frippery around him, antagonizing everyone around him, including his fellow American diplomats. \n\nIn the new republic after the war, we tread into territory unfamiliar to visual media - the wrangling and ideological factionalism within the Washington administration, threatening to tear apart the fragile newborn society.  It is into this environment that Adams finally emerges as President, with his greatest errors and moral victories shown with equal diligence and honesty.  He is enraged by criticism, but wary of the opposite insanities (as he sees them) being put forward by Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nThe sublime greatness of this miniseries isn't complete though until we follow Adams beyond his political career, and watch the aftermath of it unfold in his personal life - his private joys and tragedies.  A family whose company he sacrificed for long years to be away on the business of his country unfolds with recognizable human logic.  The quiet uneventfulness of the extended epilogue episode is not an afterthought though - it is essential.  It's what he fought for.\n\nNothing in either film or television has ever depicted the American founding years as clearly, with as much cultural and spiritual insight, as this miniseries, so \"John Adams\" is a shining example of Platinum Age TV that demands to be seen again and again.  Critics apparently agreed, since it won **thirteen** Emmys and four Golden Globes.\n\nWiki:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(miniseries)\n\nIntro:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxSLIgNKYZY\n\nSpeech where he accepts his nomination as a Massachusetts delegate to the continental Congress:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2FAAVPX-jg\n",

Really grinds my gears as I tried to do right by paying to own these episodes \u2014 not just downloading them. Thanks ~~Google~~ FX.\n\nSo, FYI: if you buy media on ~~Google Play~~ most digital stores, you're getting some ads with that. \n\n****\nEdit: It seems that it may be FX that inserts the ads, not Google, as /u/j5kDM3akVnhv pointed out below. Still not happy, but it the focus of the attention is on the networks instead.\n\nWhat's worse is they don't even get creative and switch the ads up. If I want to binge the whole season while I work from home today I have to watch the exact same set of ads over and over, before *and* after each episode. I hate that I have to watch ads on something I bought, but they could have at least put in a little effort to make the ads enjoyable or entertaining.",

Since it's animation, it arguably doesn't really matter, since you can animate anything you want.\n\nBut in the King of the Hill episode \"Sleight of Hank\", which features a stage magician as a one-time character, the animators went to the trouble of animating the illusions so that they are consistent with the way a real magician would perform them. I thought this was interesting, and I've compiled an [album](http://imgur.com/gallery/EFhdM) of screenshots from \"Sleight of Hank\" to show just how much trouble they went to.\n\n(I would have linked directly to the album, but apparently /r/television frowns on direct links to images and albums. Hopefully this post is enough to convince you that the album contains legitimate content.)\n\nThe King of the Hill animators wanted the show to feel real. Animation fans might be aware of the list of [King of the Hill Do's and Don'ts](http://imgur.com/a/PiJLk) that animators of the show consulted.\n\nI think King of the Hill shows how animation can be used, not only to create whimsical and fantastic worlds, but also to showcase observations about real life.",

The life of a married couple (Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant) is turned upside down when she becomes an undead for some reason, and needs to feed on human meat.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised, because it's funnier than I expected. The dialogue is on point, and Barrymore and Olyphant sell the hell out of it.\n\nWho knew Olyphant was so good at comedy? The dialogue and his deliveries are the strengths of the show.  \n\nThe are also good narrative choices, such as having the daughter be in on it from the beginning, which allows her to be involved in the main plot. Her and the neighbour kid are very good.\n\nGood guest stars (Andy Richter, Nathan Fillion, Patton Oswalt).\n\nI read the critics appreciated the show but criticized the gore. Personally, I find the gore hilarious. It creates a great contrast with the upbeat tone of the show, and its suburban setting.\n\nFavourite quote:\n\n\"We need a body.\"\n\n\"Are you going to fuck it?\"\n\n\"....... Yes. We're going to fuck it.\"\n\n\nRecommended to all.",

Add to that it's also pretty annoying having to spend the first 5 minutes of a show trying to remember what happened last week.\n\nThe biggest annoyance for me though, isn't the weekly waiting, but the seasonal waiting that breaks up a single season into two or more parts (I'm looking at you walking dead.), especially when it's paired with random 2+ week breaks multiple times per season half.\n\nThe perfect example of this is Agents of shield which just came back from a three week break in the middle of the first half of the season, which it self will no doubt be broken up (Because they do it every season.) into two parts with a several month long break in the middle. \n\nI understand that they're trying to spread the show out over the year to help with ratings and avoid the holidays when people have less time to watch shows, but holy shit is it ever annoying to deal with as a viewer.",

It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast\u2019s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case \"[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)\" which held that a site critical of a company\u2019s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names\u2014in this case taubmansucks.com\u2014were free speech)\n\n[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)\u2019s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.\n\nCompanies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can\u2019t trust companies like Comcast to just \"behave\" when they have abused their power time and time again.\n\nFight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.\n",

This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. \n\nReddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!\n\nNet neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.\n\nThis day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.\n\nThe current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. \n\nSo! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a \"site blocked\" message to show they could be censored, or an \"upgrade your Internet service to access this site\" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",

            "body": "Comcast's data cap policy is a flawed consumer control measure against those who would go without cable and a direct action against companies that have actually innovated over the past decade rather than sit pretty on a monopoly. \n\n**Why this is flawed:**\n\n\n**There is no guarantee of accuracy or transparency:**\n\nRegardless of your stance on the matter there should be no argument that internet usage amounts should be accurate and transparent to users affected by it. However that is not the case at all, there is no third party government agency in charge of regulating broadband metering. Comcast contracts out its metering to a third party vendor and its methods of measurement are internal and not open to the public at all. Just this year alone Comcast has received [thirteen thousand complaints about their data caps and their terrible accuracy in measurement](https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/The-FCC-Has-Received-13000-Complaints-About-Comcast-Data-Caps-135895).  Almost everyone who has to deal with this caps seems to have a story of their ISP charging them for data usage that would be impossible given their current bandwidth. \n\n**Discourages cord cutting and stifles competition:** \n\nData caps exist solely as a consumer control measure to stifle competition and cause users to be biased against applications based on the data amount they use. For example [Netflix which lists high quality HD as using 3 GB per hour and Ultra HD as using 7gb per hour](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) is immediately affected by this. As Ultra HD becomes more common and using 7gb of data for an hour of video streaming becomes common place users affected by data caps will hit their limits more easily causing them to be charged overages. This will cause users to drop Netflix in favor of less data intensive services which Comcast will only be too happy to provide through cable. Families of five living in a home with heavy Netflix usage will already be pushing this current limit.\n\nThis isn't just for videos of course, people who use services like Steam will be hit just as hard especially as the size of games increases, data intensive services that would have otherwise been developed will languish on the vine as data caps cause consumers to be biased against them.  \n\n**Users have little choice in what ISP they must subscribe to:**\n\nThe Internet is no longer a luxury that most can live without. For many it has become an essential utility much like electricity.\n\nIn any thread regarding complaints against Comcast or any ISP for that matter the main complaint of users is that they have no choice in their ISP (\"Save us Google Fiber!\"). Those lucky enough to live in major metropolitan areas may be fortunate enough to have the choice of maybe two or more ISPs but for many users the local ISP is the only choice they have which grants that business a monopoly in their area. In a happier world there would be dozens of ISPs each competing with each other and vying for market share so the poor behavior of one company only provides an opportunity for another to gain more customers. Sadly most Americans don't live in that kind of free economic environment. \n\n\n**What we need to do:**\n\nHow do consumers collectively fight this when they have little recourse in their choice of ISP?\nThe FCC is currently investigating data caps as a practice. If we as consumers just accept data caps the FCC will have less reason to crack down so it is imperative that the public puts pressure on the FCC. We're back to the Net Neutrality fight all over again as data caps are just a proxy issue that allows Comcast to achieve the same thing it wanted with its draconian net neutrality rules. \n\nSome users may be currently exempt from data caps but this behavior will absolutely roll down hill to other ISPs once they realize that consumers will accept it. Then you'll have to deal with your own little small town version of Comcast with little recourse. \n\nMuch like the behavior of the last Net Neutrality fight calling the FCC directly has a huge impact. \n\nFCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322\n\n[If you can't call directly you can file an online form to register your complaint.](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)\n\nLike before we need to raise public awareness of this issue and flood the FCC with our complaints and input so we don't have to deal with a stifled internet. \n\n**EDIT 1:**\nSome users have mentioned that the online forum and phone line isn't working out for them.\nAnother number that you can use to submit a comment or complaint.\n\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000\n\nThis was also a number we used to contact in order to urge Tom Wheeler to stand for Net Neutrality once again we can call and urge Mr. Wheeler to stand with the internet once again. However please remember that there are real people on the other side of the line. \n\n\n\n**EDIT 2:**\n\n**If you so choose to give the office of Tom Wheeler((202) 418-1000) or the FCC complaint line(1-888-225-5322) a call here's a handy script you can use. Feel free to add on or improvise on this:**\n\n\"I'm calling FCC Chairman Wheeler to urge him to stand with Internet users and pass strong, loophole-free rules against so called Data Caps. There is no legitimate, technical reason for these data caps. Comcast itself [admitted](https://gizmodo.com/comcast-will-cap-more-peoples-data-because-of-fairness-1740913276) in [internal customer service guidelines that these caps aren\u2019t about network congestion](https://i.imgur.com/quf68FC.jpg). Instead, it claims these data caps are about \u201cfairness,\u201d but the broadband industry continues to see higher revenues and profits with lower costs overall and there\u2019s no argument that these caps are based on any \u201cfair\u201d costs that Internet usage causes. The real reason behind these caps is to protect Comcast\u2019s monopoly over cable TV, making it more expensive for customers to \u201ccut the cord\u201d even if they want to choose other video options. And by exempting only its own online video application from the cap, Comcast gives Stream TV an advantage over all competing online video applications. \"\n\nReplace Comcast with your own local ISP or ISPs in general. \n\n*Script and sources shamelessly lifted from [Battleforthenet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?title-x-committees=1#top).\n\n\n**EDIT 3:**\n\nThe key to this fight will sadly not be a single set of calls made to the FCC but rather a sustained campaign of public pressure and complaint. Long after this thread's karma decays and it falls off the pages people still need let their voices be heard. There will be more threads in the future to bring attention to this we wont go down without a fight.\n\n   **Points of Contact:**\n\n\nFCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322\n\n\nOffice of FCC chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000)\n\n\nFCC Fax: 1-866-418-0232\n\n\n\n[FCC Online Complaint Form](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)\n\n**Remember to contact your local senator to voice your concerns!**\n\n",

His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. \n \nWe can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai\u2019s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. \n \nHere\u2019s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  \n \nThey\u2019re hoping we don\u2019t notice and that they won\u2019t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.\n \nHere are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai\u2019s attack on net neutrality:\n \n* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)\n* Rep.

Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)\n \nAll of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)\n \n**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** \n \nWe can\u2019t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai\u2019s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it\u2019s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai\u2019s plan. It\u2019s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.\n\nEDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn\u2019t an explicit endorsement of Pai\u2019s plan at the FCC, it\u2019s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too. \n \n* Sen.

I just came here recently to act as their pilot.. but have IT skills as well. The guy who set these pc's up didn't know how to prevent it, or set a metered connection. I am completely livid.

It's a stressful environment to be sure. And to those criticizing about the lack of proper IT staff.. There's a lot of things we could wish for. You just try to do the best you can with what's available.. this is the bush.. and it's a worthy cause.  \n\u00a0  \nIt's against the rules for me to post links here, but a mod has given permission to mention our facebook page (where you can learn more about our work and how you can support with our linked crowdfunding page).

Also, If you are interested in seeing more about our operation (imgur albums) check out my comment below (with proof too).. thanks alot  \n\u00a0  \n***Edit #2***: /u/FATstuntman suggested that if we raised the money for the ultralight plane, we name it Planey McPlaneface.

I can speak towards bush flying in general & bush IT stuff.. but I'll get my founder to join in and answer the cooler questions about anti-poaching life & the organization. So if you're interested, we'll try to set that up for Saturday the 4th @ 11:30 EST :) thanks everyone.  \n\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n",

Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. \n\nI know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.\n\nComcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.\n\nThe Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).\n\n\n\nEDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have >500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.\n\nPlenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.\n\nEDIT 2: People asked for the source code. PLEASE USE THE CLEANED UP CODE BELOW. I am by no means some fancy programmer so there is no need to point out that my code is ugly or could be better. http://pastebin.com/WMEh802V \n\nEDIT 3: Please consider using the code some folks put together to improve on mine (people who actually program.)

            "body": "Hey reddit, I wanted to give another quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** planned for July 12th that tons of major websites, subreddits, online communities, and Internet users are helping organize.\n\nThe momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. \n\nReddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!\n\nWe've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) \n\nEDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.\n\n**Important context from my previous update below.**\n\nNet neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.\n\nThis day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.\n\nThe current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. \n\nSo! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a \"site blocked\" message to show they could be censored, or an \"upgrade your Internet service to access this site\" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**\n\n**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",

            "body": "*Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*\n\nI am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast\u2019s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit\u2019s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for \u201cUnreturned\u201d equipment and other fees.\n\n**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**\n\n* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story\n* Address Comcast\u2019s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast\u2019s fees\n\n\n**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**\n\n**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.\n\nDuring the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.\n\n\n**Part 2 - COMCAST\u2019S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST\u2019S NOTORIOUS FEES**\n\nAs noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of \u201cAnnoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices.\" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).\n\nThen, *after* my [Comcast\u2019s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast\u2019s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.\n\nWhen I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my \u201cComcast fees\u201d post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast\u2019s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede \u2013 flat out \u2013 a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast\u2019s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a \u201cSpecial / Going Public\u201d customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).\n\nAll indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia \u2013 and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.\n\nComcast\u2019s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.\nComcast\u2019s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.\nComcast\u2019s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.\n\n**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then \u2013 if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible & overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, & International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they\u2019ve created.\n\nIt appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.  \n\nBut believe me when I say this with heartfelt sincerity: I feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls.",

They can do what they want, since I have no other options. http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg\n[](http://youtu.be/PRLgG9ctZGg)\n\nEDIT: I'm glad this is getting some attention. Last night I sent the video to We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com and\necare@comcast.com , as well as the tips address for the Consumerist. Today I submitted an FCC complaint per the suggestion of /u/BarbwireCake. I've only received an automated response from Comcast so far. Some are suggesting that a class action lawsuit might be a catalyst for change; I'm not sure. I will update when I hear from someone.\n(12:17PST)\nFiled with BBB and posted to [twitter](https://twitter.com/Sweetlethargy/status/550033447729643520)\n(13:04PST)\n\nEDIT:\nI spoke with someone from Comcast Executive Customer Relations. He wanted to discuss my complaint, but refused to be recorded. I record all of my calls with creditors so that I won't be promised something that is never delivered. As I found out yesterday, it might not even matter if the call has been recorded. Luckily this thread got some attention today, so I might actually get help with this issue. He assured me that I would change my mind about Comcast after speaking with him but I declined to continue the conversation. I've obviously learned my lesson today about keeping accurate records, and I don't want to hear anymore crocodile tears or pseudo-promises.\nIn any case, he said he would email me details of our non-conversation, which I will place here:\n\n--\nHello /u/sweetlethargy, I regret not being able to consent to your recording our conversation due to  the nature of the reasons or possible intent that you may have for the recording. In reviewing the original and unedited version of your initial call, the agent gave you correct information on the service plan and promotional services at the time of the call. This is the product and service that you spoke about:\n\nInternet Plus 09/06 - 10/05 69.95\n\nIncludes Limited Basic, HBO, Streampix, a\nStandard Definition Digital Converter and\nRemote For The Primary Outlet, and\nPerformance Internet.\n\nService Discount -19.96\n\nTotal XFINITY TV $49.99 plus taxes and fees\n\nFranchise Fee 1.42\n\nUtility Tax 2.00\n\nPEG Access Support 0.28\n\nState Sales Tax 0.16\n\nFCC User Fee 0.09\n\nTotal Taxes, Surcharges & Fees $3.95 (these vary slightly per month and are only collected by Comcast)\n \nDocsis 3 Owned Mdm 09/06 - 10/05 0.00\n\nBlast! Internet Svc 09/06 - 10/05 11.00\n\nService Discount -11.00\n\nTotal XFINITY Internet $0.00 (this was added after your conversation with the agent as a bonus) which may have caused this confusion\n\nWe have extended this promotional offer as a gesture of good will for an additional 12 months as long as you understand that at the end of that term if you wish to keep it, it will be billed at its standard rate.\n--\n\nIt seems that they aren't accepting responsibility for anything, but they are offering me something. Here is my response. (All I want is what I was quoted):\n\n--\nBottom line: do I have 100mbps down, 25mbps up, no contract, at $53.85 total per month including taxes and all other fees for 12 months?\n--\n\nIm waiting for a response.\n\nFor people who were asking, I used the android app Automatic Call Recorder by Appliqato. Everyone should record conversations with their creditors to keep them accountable.\n(18:24PST)\n\n**FINAL UPDATE:**\n\nJust spoke with an \"Executive Customer Relations Supervisor\" who apologized for the actions of the two customer retention reps, as well as the Executive Customer Relations rep who refused to be recorded yesterday. She was very polite, took full responsibility for Comcast's mistakes, and allowed me to record our conversation. She explained that \"both representatives you reached were freshly out of a training class\" and they \"should've placed you on hold\" to get more information. This is strange, since I could clearly hear the second rep being coached on what to say... \n\nIn any case, the Executive Customer Relations Supervisor said she would credit me a month of service as a sign of good will. She also explained that I would be receiving the promotional rate through August 15th 2015, however, due to the fluctuation of taxes and fees, she could not guarantee my final cost of $53.85. This month the final cost would be $55.55, for example. I indicated that all I wanted was the out-the-door $53.85 cost that I was quoted in August. I agree that the dollar amount is negligable, but all I've wanted is the price I was quoted when I agreed to keep the service. She agreed to credit my account $5 every month so that at no time I would be expected to pay more than $53.85.\n\nToday I Learned that if Comcast pushes you around, the best course of action is to expose them on social media. I can honestly say that this has been easier, less time consuming, and less stressful to make and post the video than it would've been to dial 1-800-COMCAST again. I hope these Comcast horror stories continue to get posted so that something might change one day. Proper competition is the only answer to this solution, and I personally feel that public utilies should also operate as ISPs.\n\nEveryone should be recording their interactions with creditors, as it is obviously the only way to keep them (somewhat) honest. It's sad that I was granted my simple request only after my video had been posted to the Consumerist, Techdirt, BGR, Gawker, yahoo, etc, etc... I realize that most people will simply never receive help with their complaints.\n\nGood luck to all of you who are dealing with similar situations.\n\n**tldr; I'm now getting what I was quoted: 100mbps down, 25mbps up, through August 15th, no contract, for no more than $53.85 per month.**\n\n(12/31/2014 11:08PST)\n",

            "body": "**Update 12:51pm EST 12/22/2015:** The FCC claims these comments weren't lost. See new thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2q358f/fcc_claims_net_neutrality_comments_were_not_lost/\n\n---\n**Update 7:42pm EST 12/19/2014:** This situation isn't hopeless. Insiders think the FCC will come out with a Title II rule. The hard part will be defending it from a Comcast-captured Congress. That's why it's so bad for us that the FCC botched these numbers; it makes the public look divided, when it's not. What can you do? Write Congress at www.battleforthenet.com, and generally be ready for when shit hits the fan in January/February. We'll need local volunteers in major cities to organize protests & stunts aimed at members of Congress. If you can help, email team@fightforthefuture.org. We're a 501c3 / 501c4 fueled by donations. [Those help too :)](https://donate.fightforthefuture.org)\n\n---\nEarlier this week, Sunlight Foundation [released a study](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/12/16/one-group-dominates-the-second-round-of-net-neutrality-comments/) claiming that anti-Title II comments from a group with ties to the Koch Brothers \u201cdominated\u201d the second round of FCC commenting, beating out comments from pro-net neutrality groups like EFF and Fight for the Future. Now, [anti-net neutrality groups](http://www.americancommitment.org/content/conservatives-opposed-internet-regulation-won-fcc-comment-period-landslide) and [journalists](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/dirty-data-why-the-4-million-public-comments-on-net-neutrality-might-not-be-what-they-seem/) are seizing on this report to try to make it look like the public is against Title II net neutrality. The problem is, the FCC\u2019s data was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments, and I can prove it. To make things worse, Sunlight\u2019s study counted every anti-net neutrality comment while systematically ignoring pro-net neutrality comments. It\u2019s a mess.\n\n**Full disclosure:** I\u2019m Jeff Lyon, CTO at Fight for the Future, a pro-net neutrality group responsible for driving 777,364 pro-net neutrality comments through the Battle for the Net campaign. I\u2019m posting this here, along with all of our evidence, with the hope that Reddit can help us verify these claims.\n\n**The FCC data dump was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments.**\n\nThe raw data [the FCC released](http://www.fcc.gov/blog/fcc-releases-open-internet-reply-comments-public) and that Sunlight used for its study was missing hundreds of thousands of pro-net neutrality comments sent from Battle for the Net. I noticed this and emailed the FCC\u2019s Chief Enterprise Architect, who confirmed via email that, of over 525,000 comments we submitted via CSV, _at least_ 244,811 were missing from the data that the FCC released (**[screenshot of email from FCC](http://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/fcc_email_redacted.png)**). As of right now, the failure point is still unclear: did the FCC simply fail to export these comments, or did they actually fail to process them in the first place?\n\nWorse, of the comments the FCC _did_ include, Sunlight found that 95,000 of them were duplicates\u2014the same comment showing up multiple times, and this means an additional 95,000 of the unique comments we sent are missing. (I verified we did in fact send unique comments by examining reference numbers attached to them, can\u2019t exactly prove this without violating our privacy policy)\n\nTaking 244,811 + 95,000 gives us _at least_ 339,811 pro-net neutrality comments that are provably missing from the data. This is alone is enough to unseat Sunlight\u2019s (methodologically-flawed) conclusion that anti-net neutrality comments \u201cdominated\u201d the second round, and the total number of missing comments is probably much higher.\n\nSunlight analyzed 1,674,385 comments and determined a 60 / 40 split between anti- / pro-net neutrality comments. They didn\u2019t specify, but if we conservatively assume that 0% of the comments were undecided or ambiguous, then this amounts to 1,004,631 anti-net neutrality and 669,754 comments. Adding in the 339,811 proveably missing pro-net neutrality comments gives us 1,009,565, shifting the dominant group in favor of net neutrality (this margin would be increased if we assumed more than 0% of comments were ambiguous, and if Sunlight\u2019s logic wasn\u2019t completely flawed [more on that soon]).\n\n\n**There are probably many more missing comments.**\n\nThe total number of missing comments is probably much higher than the number I\u2019ve (thus far) identified. To help establish this, it\u2019s useful to examine the different ways that people could submit net neutrality comments to the FCC, as well as the precise approach I used to determine these numbers.\n\nIn the beginning, there was [ECFS](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment_search/execute?proceeding=14-28), the FCC\u2019s online commenting system. This system is over a decade old and melted down from the hundreds of thousands of comments sent through Battle for the Net and by fans of [comedian John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU) during the first round of net neutrality comments. (I believe on good authority that the FCC has just one server running the entire ECFS web site :)\n\nThe FCC soon realized that ECFS wasn\u2019t working, and [started accepting comments by email](http://www.fcc.gov/page/fcc-establishes-new-inbox-open-internet-comments). However in September, right before the second net neutrality commenting deadline, the FCC made it possible to submit comments in bulk using CSV spreadsheets. Given the sheer volume of comments we were collecting through Battle for the Net, this option made the most sense in order to ensure timely delivery to the FCC.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that CSV option was unreliable. Over half the comments we submitted via CSV were missing from the FCC\u2019s final data, and in Sunlight\u2019s study, no comments were attributed to some other big companies that participated with Battle for the Net and submitted CSV comments on behalf of their users. If the FCC actually failed to process comments from these groups, the total number of pro-net neutrality comments would be even higher.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, the technique I used to determine the missing CSV comments is simplistic and only establishes a floor, not a ceiling, for the possible total missing. Here\u2019s what I did:\n\n* Battle for the Net submitted 527,952 unique comments via CSV to the FCC between the dates of September 12 and September 15\n* Of these comments, 525,189 contained the phrase \u2018We are writing to urge you to implement\u2019 (people were signing onto an open letter from Senator Angus King)\n* If all of these were counted, we would expect to see at least as many occurrences of that phrase in the [raw data](http://www.fcc.gov/files/ecfs/14-28/R-14-28-02-SOLR-RAW.zip ) released by the FCC, but instead there were only 374,421 occurrences.\n* Of these, 374,421 occurrences, FCC\u2019s Chief Enterprise Architect confirmed via email (**[screenshot of another email from FCC](http://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/emails.png)**) that 92,645 were from comments submitted through the FCC\u2019s email address, meaning that 281,776 is the maximum number of comments possibly from the CSV files in their data, and they were missing at least 244,811.\n* We only did a basic text search to arise at this number. If other people submitted comments with the phrase \u2018We are writing to urge you to implement\u2019, it would mean that _even less_ of our CSV comments made it into the final data.\n* And of the 374,421 matches that were in the data, Sunlight confirmed that at least 95,000 were duplicate records, meaning that at least another 95,000 of the comments we sent are also missing.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know whether comments submitted via ECFS were properly reflected in the FCC\u2019s data. I\u2019m running a full analysis, comparing our data to theirs, but it will take some time to complete.\n\n**To make things worse, Sunlight\u2019s study counted every anti-net neutrality comment and systematically ignored pro-net neutrality comments**\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation studied the FCC\u2019s data and concluded that comments from net neutrality activists were eclipsed by anti-regulatory comments from American Commitment, a known astroturfing group with ties to the Koch Brothers (they sent paid emails with misleading messages, but that\u2019s [another story](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-conservative-anti-net-neutrality-movement-that-wasnt)). However, Sunlight applied a flawed sampling methodology to a flawed set of data, and drew conclusions that are impossible to make with any \u201creasonably representative\u201d certainty.\n\nIn particular, of the 2.4 million comments released by the FCC, they ignored 800,000 comments that they couldn\u2019t parse, and assumed these comments maintained the same distribution of pro- vs. anti- net neutrality comments. They\u2019ve said the 1.6 million comments they did look at were \u201creasonably representative\u201d of the whole group, but have provided no evidence to support that claim.\n\nI\u2019ve looked at the data myself. It\u2019s extremely inconsistent, with comments in a multitude of formats, some plaintext, some XML, and many simply as concatenated strings with no delimiting characters separating them from one another. It\u2019s generally very difficult to parse. However, it\u2019s extremely easy to pick out and parse the email comments, as they tend to follow a consistent format.\n\nThe group of commenters that \u201cdominated\u201d the second round of comments (in Sunlight\u2019s words) could have simply been the one organization that\u2013due to the technique it used for submitting\u2013didn\u2019t get all its submissions garbled. In fact, it looks like that\u2019s what happened. The FCC counted _all 92,645_ of the comments we sent via email, and failed to parse comments we sent via CSV. On the other hand, _all 777,364_ anti-net neutrality comments from American Commitment were sent via email, present in the FCC\u2019s data, and counted in Sunlight\u2019s study.\n\nWhat this means is that, after Sunlight threw 800,000 comments away, half of their remaining sample pool of 1.6 million comments are easily parseable emails from American Commitment.\n\nIt is erroneous to assume that you can throw away a third of your data and that the distribution of the remaining data will be unaffected. Taking this further, Sunlight has publicly acknowledged a non-trivial difference in how they counted some comments from pro-net neutrality groups like Free Press versus comments from American Commitment.\n\nAll groups were effectively collecting signatures on a letter. American Commitment submitted them as a barrage of identical comments, while groups like Free Press submitted them as signatures on a single letter. The FCC says it recognizes and counts both. But Sunlight Foundation admits they chose to treat them differently, excluding multiple signatures on a single letter from the count.\n\nThis further confounded the result of their study in favor of anti-net neutrality commenters.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* FCC failed to process hundreds of thousands of net neutrality comments\n* Sunlight Foundation based a study on the FCC\u2019s data, counted every anti-net neutrality comment and systematically ignored pro-net neutrality comments. Concluded that anti-net neutrality \u201cdominated\u201d\n* Political pundits and journalists are spinning this to say that the public is against net neutrality\n* I wanted to get the facts out in the hopes that Reddit verify this, further analyze the FCC's data, and help figure out what's going on.",

            "body": "***[PSA--Long post ahead. tl;dr for the first half of this: You might be getting spied on. Skip to the numbered part and I'll teach you how to protect yourself. I will not explain in detail how these things work in this post, because I want anyone, regardless of their tech prowess, to find these suggestions accessible. It is also because I am by no means an expert in this area, and do not wish to spread misinformation. Luckily, the information is readily available all over the net, if you would like to know more.]***\n\n> **(UPDATE 12/20/2015: I just want to point out that I am aware that a few of my suggestions have been disputed in the comments. I am *OKAY* with that. In fact, I *encourage* it. A few people seem to be getting heated, and there is just no reason for that. I am just some dude on the internet looking to help out. These are all just suggestions that work *for me*. I am sharing with you what I know. None of these tips will cause you any harm, I promise, though an alternative might suit *your* purposes better. Please, I implore you to take what I say with a grain of salt and do your own research. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong in the comments, but please be kind to one another. I will make updates and corrections as needed, so please check back now and again.)**\n\nI promise, I am not as crazy and paranoid as this post is about to make me seem. This is just an important issue to me as a techy/geek. [This is important for you as well, I swear](http://www.zdnet.com/article/if-you-have-nothing-to-hide-heres-where-to-send-your-passwords/), so grab your tinfoil hats and come to [Crazy Town](http://www.weebls-stuff.com/other-toons/video/aaaaaaaaaaaaahaha.html) with me for a moment.\n\nBasically, [CISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_Information_Sharing_Act) has been signed into law. For those that don't know what this means, many corporations and the Department of Homeland Security now have greater access to your online activity and can do with it what they will. There are scary implications of this that I could ramble about; but, honestly, they will *probably* never happen to you or I. But it's the principle of the thing that concerns me.\n\nThere are three important things that everyone should have a right to as a \"citizen of the internet\": *Privacy*, *Anonymity*, and *Security*. CISA is a blatant invasion of the first two, particularly Privacy. You do not have to be doing anything illegal to warrant a need to private access to the internet. You just simply should not be spied on. You are being violated. It doesn't matter if you're just returning an email to your grandma, or buying some shoes--there is no reason that your activity should be monitored, recorded, and passed around unless there is some solid evidence pointing to you extorting your grandma or stealing those shoes.\n\nThe legislation was [trojan-horsed](http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/18/house-senate-pass-budget-with-cisa/) in on a budget bill and signed off by the Prez himself, so nothing can be done to reverse it. At least not yet. The good news is, there are things *YOU* can do right now to maintain your rights. *All of the following tips are completely legal (in the USA), freely available, relatively simple to use, and within your rights to use as you wish.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Pro tips begin here!]**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1. Privacy:** Use a VPN service. [Cyberghost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us?utm_expid=85864364-18._HAGhHhTTvKkQRZylpXQXw.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) and ~~TunnelBear~~ both offer excellent free services. If you want even better service, there are a few excellent paid services, as well (I don't know any well enough to endorse one, but I've heard good things about NordVPN. It's got 256-bit AES encryption and is completely logless). \n\n> (**UPDATE:** It was brought to my attention that TunnelBear, while adorable, is not logless and is hosted within the USA. It is therefor not recommended for privacy. It's good if you want to get around a site blocker at work or school, but for REAL privacy, use a reputable paid VPN service. Regardless of arguments, though, the free version of Cyberghost *will* help you maintain Privacy. It is hosted out of the US, it is logless, and they make their revenue from paid subscriptions and will not sell your information. That is not to say that a paid service is not better, it's just that Cyberghost's free service will be safe for you to use.)\n\nThe merit of VPNs is debated around the internet, but I have found them to be indispensable in maintaining my own privacy, as they are quick and easy to connect to and are one of the simplest and most effective tools of allowing you to maintain your privacy. \n\nThere are also small program switches you can make. For example, switch from Skype to [qTox](https://tox.chat/). It is a more steady, reliable program that offers all of the same services as Skype, but with excellent end-to-end encryption and it's logless, much like a good VPN. Your conversations will remain between you and the other person only. It's also available on a wide variety of platforms, so it should work for almost anyone. \n\nAlso consider using a more secure email provider. If you want to keep it net-based, use ~~HushMail~~. If you like a client installed on your PC, combine your secure email account with a program called [ThunderBird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/), which allows you to easily manage multiple email accounts, among other cool, secure features. \n\n> (**UPDATE:** I stand corrected. /u/theforcereturns was able to show me that HushMail is *NOT* your most secure option. A much better option, as per his recommendation, would be [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/). I've looked into it, and I will be making the switch myself. It's based out of Switzerland and has true end-to-end encryption, among other features that help to privatize and anonymity your email, PLUS--it's free. Super rad. The only downside is that as of now, you have to request an invite and wait for an account due to their need to expand the size of their servers.\n\n> He also wanted me to include some information regarding instant messaging. He recommended [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal/) or [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). Signal, in particular, as it was developed by a highly reputable team--however, it is only available for mobile devices. Telegram offers a client for PC, as well. I have personally used [Wickr](https://www.wickr.com/), and I know it to be very secure and reliable. \n\n> If you MUST use Facebook Messenger (*which I do not recommend in the slightest*), then the best way to do it is to connect through [Pigdin](https://pidgin.im/) with the [OTR Plug-In](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) and the current [Messenger compatability](https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook/wiki#basic-usage). The only drag is that your other party MUST have this setup, too, and you will have to authenticate each other. But the plus is that your Facebook messages will be encrypted. Still though, either way, don't send sensitive messages over Facebook. Never. Never ever. Don't. Like... do not. Ever.\n\nAnother good idea is to reconsider the search engines you use. Google and Bing are notorious data compilers. I use ~~DuckDuckGo~~ instead. It's fast, accurate, and totally private and anonymous. They do not collect data on you. \n\n> (**UPDATE:** Some redditors are claiming DuckDuckGo to be less-than-reputable. I can't confirm or deny that as of now, so in lieu of that, I suggest you check out [StartPage](https://startpage.com/) or [PrivateSearch.io](https://www.privatesearch.io/). Both are great, secure search engines. StartPage is slowly becoming my new personal favorite.)\n\nI also want to mention (legal) File Sharing. I'd like to add that [BitDrop](https://bitdropapp.com/) is an awesome tool for anonymous, secure file sharing between your devices. As mentioned above, qTox also has secure file sharing capability.\n\nYou can also get a free [MEGA](https://mega.nz/#fm/c1UwVZAZ) account. While not the most secure, if you use Winrar or 7Zip to create an encrypted RAR file with a conspicuous name and send it over HushMail, Tox, etc. to your friend/receiver of the file separate from the decryption password/MEGA access code, it will be secure enough (for non-sensitive documents and files), and you can upload up to 50GB with a free account. Just remember to delete the files from your account AND the rubbish bin after the other party has received them. \n\n> (**UPDATE:** MEGA is *NOT* to be used as a secure, private file sharing tool. Please see my second edit at the bottom of this post.)\n\nAnother option is to create a torrent file of the encrypted RAR file and seed it directly to the other party, after both of you have configured your torrent clients to run all traffic through a proxy.\n\nIf you're especially tech-savvy, you can even go so far as to install CFW on your router, provided it's supported, like [Tomato](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato) or [DD-WRT](http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index). Tomato in particular will allow you to actively monitor your bandwidth activity to see who is accessing your network, or even just to see if Comcast is throttling your Netflix usage. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2. Anonymity:** Again, you don't have to be a criminal to want to keep your anonymity online. Download the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en). It's a modified version of Firefox that allows you to route all of your activity online through the Onion server network. *(Pro tip: Tor will not protect you when downloading or torrenting anything, legal or not. If you engage in a peer-to-peer download, you will inevitably upload real personal information about your system, AND it slows down the Tor network for everybody else. The safest way to download is through a [torrent client](http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=38?download) that has been [configured to work with a Proxy or VPN](https://www.bolehvpn.net/utorrent.html), but nothing is guaranteed. [Here](http://samair.ru/) is a list of free public proxy servers you may use. Always check the validity of your proxy server [here](http://samair.ru/s-proxychecker/index.php) before each use).* \n\n(Please note that I **DO NOT** condone piracy or illegal activity of **ANY KIND**. I am simply suggesting uTorrent as a means of securely sharing legally obtained or created files between two parties.)\n\n> (**UPDATE:** Yes, recent versions of uTorrent have been shown to include spyware. Settle down. The version that I linked to above is version 2.2.1, arguably the best version of uTorrent, more lightweight, and spyware free. If you want to forego uTorrent entirely, go with [qBittorent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/), an open source bittorent client that I personally use in addition to uTorrent. It's excellent. A lot of redditors have also recommended Deluge, which looks promising, but I have never used it personally.)\n\nAlso, NEVER open a downloaded file while still connected to Tor, especially a PDF. There are often traces of data that \"call home\" when the file is opened, and it can void any protection Tor offers you.\n\nIt's also good practice to visit HTTPS versions of sites whenever possible, as they are more secure. The Tor bundle includes a browser plug-in called [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) that will automatically get you the most secure connection to sites whenever possible. You can also add it to your regular Chrome, Firefox, or Opera browsers, and on Android devices.\n\nYou might also consider [spoofing your MAC address](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Spoof-Your-MAC-Address/) now and again. \n\n> (**UPDATE:** Spoofing your MAC is only necessary if you think your LAN has been compromised from the \"inside.\" Otherwise, don't worry about it.)\n\nThe last thing I will say on anonymity, for the more tech-savvy again, is that you may consider using something like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to run a more secure operating system INSIDE of another operating system. You can also just install that more secure OS on a flash drive, but I find the VirtualBox to be easier to manage AND  that it provides more anonymity. I personally would recommend using [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox) with VB. It's very effective. I've also heard good things about Tails, but apparently it's not truly logless, and I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it, as I have never used it.\n\nFinally, it's important to know your stuff is working. To test my level of anonymity, I like to use [IP Check](http://ip-check.info/?lang=en) and [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3. Security:** Not really relevant to CISA, but it's important, too. ~~Ditch McAffee, Kaspersky, or whatever junk you paid for.~~ Download [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/lp/sem/?sfc=sem-gs_b_us_en&gclid=CMCSvNKO6ckCFY9gfgodrZED8Q), [Panda Antivirus](http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/free-antivirus/), and [CCleaner](https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download). \n\n> (**Update:** Just to clarify, CCleaner is NOT an antivrus, and I do not claim that it is. Clearing your registry is just a good practice for security and in general.) \n\nAll free, all easy to use, all great at what they do. Just allow them to update regularly and run automatic scans each night. If you prefer paid software, Kaspersky has the highest detection rate and is super reliable software. There are other good options, as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Final Notes:** These are just *BASIC* tips to help you protect yourself. This will not make you invisible; if someone still wants to spy on you, they could... but they'll actually have to work for it. There's a lot more you can do to abstract your digital \"fingerprint\". But either way, care about your privacy. Protect yourself. As far fetched as it seems, due to the nature of the issue, the more people that do this stuff, the more secure everyone becomes (especially in regards to Tor use).\n\n>*\"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.\"* -- Edward Snowden\n\n&nbsp;\n\n~~/Wall of text~~ *Apparently not....*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> **EDIT:** A lovely anonymous user posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3xj5fe/now_that_cisa_has_passed_here_are_some_tips_to/cy52yyp) with links to further reading, if you're interested. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> **EDIT: PART DEUX:** Some redditors have pointed out a few things to be wary of that I should have included in the original post. Later versions of uTorrent have been found to come with spyware. The version I linked to is an older version (2.2.1) and it safe for you to use. If you want to forego uTorrent altogether, qBittorent is an excellent alternative, that I use myself on occasion. It's completely open source, which is groovy, too. \n\n> Also, MEGA is NOT by any means a secure way of file sharing. I meant to say that if it is NOT a particularly sensitive document you're sending, and it's encrypted, it works in a pinch. Please do not rely on it for secure sharing. There are some good recommendations below in the comments for you to investigate. I won't name any specific ones, as I have not tested them myself. \n\n> Also Also, one user (I lost his name in the vast ocean that is my inbox--I now I understand what \"RIP My Inbox\" means--but as soon as I find it again, I will credit you, kind stranger) pointed out that unless you select the options to ENCRYPT the email you send with HushMail, it will only send through the clearnet as a normal email and will NOT be secure. Don't forget to encrypt your emails, kids.\n\n> Finally, I just want to make it clear, NONE of this will make you \"invisible.\" It simply helps to scatter the information that makes up you \"fingerprint\" to A) Make it less reliable to track you with, and B) to give up less personal data to prying eyes. *YES* the contents of you hard drive are probably compromised if you're not using Whonix or Tails. *YES* the NSA can still watch you if they want to. IF someone REALLY wants to get to you, especially the govt., they still can. This isn't a guide to disappearing completely. This is a guide for the average Joe or Jane, who are not cybercriminals, to regain their privacy online. This won't save you if you're trafficking drugs, but it WILL keep a substantial amount of nosey trackers off your back and help you regain your privacy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> **HE'S EDIT AGAIN:** Holy *shit* this post blew up. First of all, THANK YOU for gold, kind stranger. That is awfully kind. I luh you.\n\n> Second, a lot of people are discussing what I recommended for \"Security.\" First of all, I said straight up, it basically has nothing to do with CISA. It's just something I believe to be a fundamental right as an internet user and wanted to include. But I also apologize for referring to paid anti-virus software as \"junk.\" Most of it is not junk, I do not mean to confuse you. I used Kaspersky for a year or two back in 2011 or so, and it was great. A lot of those programs have a lot to offer, and they work very well. For my purposes, the free anti-virus software does everything I need it to do and more, so it is not worth it to pay for the software. Your purposes may be different, and at the end of the day, it's all about what works for you. So, no, paid antivirus software is not junk. I apologize for the misrepresentation.  \n\n> It should also be noted that spoofing your MAC is JUST for if you think you have been compromised from within your own LAN network. \n\n> As I stated before, I am no expert. Just a guy who has done a lot of research on his own, trying to do a solid for his fellow internet-users. Everything I suggest is just that--a suggestion. It's what works for me based off the research I have done. I encourage you to take my advice with a grain of salt and do research on your own to see what works for you. But I would venture to say that what I have written is a solid starting point on your journey to a more private, anonymous, and secure browsing experience. Serve hot with a side of common sense. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> **EDIT EPISODE IV: A NEW DNS SERVER:** Your DNS server. Change that shizz. I recommend [DNS.Watch](https://dns.watch/index). A redditor (who's name I'll have to hunt down) recommended it to me, I've played with it, and it's great so far. OpenDNS is also good. DON'T use Google DNS. I did for a long time.

All credit for this info goes to them whoever they are. \n\nThis info is from the internal \"Einstein\" database that is used by Comcast customer service reps. Please help spread the word and information about this greed drive crap for service Comcast is trying to expand\n\n~~[Documents here](http://imgur.com/gallery/7IHyH)~~ Got DMCA takedown'd afaik\n\nEdit: TL;DR Caps will be expanding to more areas across the Southeastern parts of the United States. Comcast customer support reps are to tell you the caps are in the interest of 'fairness'. After reaching the 300 GB cap of \"unlimited data\" you will be charged $10 for every extra 50 GB. \n\nEdit 2: THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE THIS DOWN.

This kind of spiraled out of control and became much larger than I thought it would, so let's be kind to each other in the spirit of the season and try to be constructive.  Thank you and happy holidays!**\n\nHas anyone else noticed, in the last few months especially, a huge uptick in Facebook's ability to know everything about you?  \n\nFacebook is sending me reminders about people I've snapchatted but not spoken to on Facebook yet.\n\nFacebook is advertising products to me based on conversations I've had in bars or over my microphone while using Curse at home.  Things I've never mentioned or even searched for on my phone, Facebook knows about.\n\nEvery aspect of my life that I have kept disconnected from the internet and social media, Facebook knows about.  I don't want to say that Facebook is recording our phone microphones at all time, but how else could they know about things that I have kept very personal and never even mentioned online?\n\nEven for those things I do search online - Facebook knows.  I can do a google search for a service using Chrome, open Facebook, and the advertisement for that service is there.  It's like they are reading all input and output from my phone.\n\nI guess I agreed to it by accepting their TOS, but isn't this a bit ridiculous?  They shouldn't be profiling their users to the extent they are.\n\nThere's no way to keep anything private anymore.  Facebook can \"hear\" conversations that it was never meant to.  I don't want to delete it because I do use it fairly frequently to check in on people, but it's becoming less and less worth the threat to my privacy.\n\nEDIT:  Although it's anecdotal, I feel it's worth mentioning that my friends have been making the same complaints lately, but in regard to the text messages they are sending.  I know the subjects of my texts have been appearing in Facebook ads and notifications as well.  **It's just not right.**",

            "body": "My Congressman's response:\n\nI would like to thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I appreciate hearing about issues that are important to my constituents.\n \nAs you may know, net neutrality refers to the principle of the open and free internet. Under this principle Internet Service Providers (ISP) provide equal access to all lawful internet traffic, and consumers are free to choose what content they wish to access. The main focus of debate over net neutrality has been whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient for policy makers to address this issue, or whether they should look to Congress to amend current law.\n \nSince the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed into law, new technologies and advancements in telecommunications have rapidly developed due to the limited government regulation of internet traffic and services. However, on February 26th, 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband Internet as a telecommunication service under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This essentially allows the FCC to reclassify broadband as a utility giving the FCC more regulatory authority over Internet providers. \n \nOver the past 20 years the Internet has changed the way we live our lives, from how we get the news to how we pay our bills. Now the FCC is reaching back 80 years for their authority to reclassify broadband Internet service as a public utility, a move that will not only open the Internet up to heavier regulations and additional taxes, but would disincentive the development and deployment of faster Internet service throughout the nation. \n \nWhile President Obama and Chairman Wheeler continue their short sighted approach to net neutrality I hope to use my position as a member of the Communication and Technology Subcommittee to push for a bi-partisan solution that will help keep the internet open and free while incentivizing the build-out of broadband services and spurring innovation in the marketplace. The Subcommittee is currently discussing draft legislation, which I support, that would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit blocking lawful content, throttling data, and paid prioritization. Moving forward please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as we continue to work on this important issue.\n \nAgain, thank you for taking the time to contact me. If you would like to keep up on this and other important issues you can follow me on Facebook, Twitter or sign up for my electronic newsletter.\n \n \nSincerely,\n \nJOHN SHIMKUS\nMember of Congress\n",

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of \u201cunlimited\u201d internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.\n\n= = = = =\n\nSources for this post:\n\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2017/4/26/15439622/fcc-net-neutrality-internet-freedom-isp-ajit-pai\n\nhttp://www.politicususa.com/2017/04/26/al-franken-explodes-rips-fcc-chairman.html\n",

Posted [here in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4m7ay6/teamviewer_has_been_hacked_they_are_denying/d3ufp8e), and sent a PM with [this post here in /r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4md95j/teamviewer_launches_trusted_devices_and_data/) ([and one at /r/teamviewer](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mcvp4/teamviewer_launches_trusted_devices_and_data/)). They also [announced an open letter to users](https://twitter.com/TeamViewer/status/738725855959101440) on Twitter ([archived here](http://archive.is/jED6k)). Link to the open letter [here](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/teamviewer-launches-trusted-devices-and-data-integrity/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social%20&utm_content=trusteddevices/dataintegrity&utm_campaign=Social) ([archived here](http://archive.is/Githe)). Right now it looks like they are trying to mitigate the problem with a band-aid, excuses and new features.  \n\n**Update 2016-06-06 (10th):** Got this in a PM from a user:    \n>They just admitted the basis for their assumption of password reuse. If your email address comes up on haveibeenpwned, they simply and blindly assume that you reuse passwords and that is the only possible reason your account is compromised.  \n[In reply to a /r/teamviewer comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mq9a5/badly_worded_sentence_or_can_teamviewer_see_our/d3xu3gc) they seem to be admitting this.  \n\nRight now, we still don't know how the unknown party have accessed the clients, even though it's been 4 days since the creation of this post.  \n*****\n\nUsers are reporting breaches, and thousands of dollars have been stolen with the client, all over /r/teamviewer and at their [support Twitter account](https://twitter.com/TeamViewer_help/with_replies). TV is blaming users with reusing passwords, [yet users with 2FA](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m4a5n/psa_2factorauthentication_use_it/d3snp7k) and [unique very long generated passwords](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4jr9qn/hacked_trough_teamviewer_1800_spent_on_paypal/d3a5tcf) were hacked.  \n\nSome also suggest that [their DNS servers were hijacked and the clients believed the fake server](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m3izy/teamviewer_dns_issues/), being the method of the attack.  \n\nOne of the main problems are that they are not taking responsibility: (quoted from /u/rich-uk)  \n>Teamviewer is being used as a vector of attack. This has happened on other sites where they had no critical information and within 48 hours everyone's logged in sessions were logged out, an email went round saying you had to click the link in the email (to verify ownership) and set up two factor auth as they knew they were being targeted.\nTeamviewer must know they are being targeted, and the stakes are high as the software allows complete access to a trusted machine - it's basically a master key - and there hasn't been a single response with teeth from teamviewer.\n\nSome info by /u/re1jo on the auth protocol [here shows that no password or 2FA would protect your machines](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4m7ay6/teamviewer_has_been_hacked_they_are_denying/d3ucnxk) (based on TV7, may have changed in never versions).  \n/u/swatspyder also [found out that](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mbx7h/my_theory_on_the_teamviewer_contact_requests_that/) The TV Management Console page had a flaw that leaked users' names and their existences, may be fixed now. Also:  \n>TeamViewer has only stated that the DDoS attack on their DNS infrastructure is unrelated to concerns about their user database being hacked: [Statement on Service Outage](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/statement-on-service-outage/)\nThey have NOT specifically denied that their user database has been compromised.\n\nA few links:  \n\n* [Official statement blaming user's passwords](http://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/statement-on-service-outage/) - [archive.is snapshot](https://archive.is/ZJubT)  \n* [Support Twitter account with user interactions](https://twitter.com/TeamViewer_help/with_replies) - [[Mirror of some]](http://i.imgur.com/vENDcNL.png) [[canned replies]](http://i.imgur.com/cRpDPRL.png) [[in case they take them down]](http://i.imgur.com/qtLxSnn.png), [archive.is snapshot of some](https://archive.is/jx3o4)  \n* [Twitter account, seems to be empty](https://twitter.com/TeamViewer/with_replies) - [archive.is snapshot](http://archive.is/yC9qv)  \n* [Facebook page with people's posts](https://www.facebook.com/teamviewer/posts_to_page/) - [archive.is snapshot](http://archive.is/6UuZL)  \n* [TV threatening writers to change articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m7j4a/i_covered_one_of_the_teamviewer_news_articles_i/) - [archive.is snapshot](http://archive.is/ES7uF)  \n* [The /r/teamviewer megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m6omd/teamviewer_breach_masterthread_please_post_your/)  \n* [The Register article on the issue](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/01/teamviewer_mass_breach_report/) - They are getting canned replies too.

I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.\"\n\n> Clinton added some caveats. \"Maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that,\" she said. The US also has to \"balance liberty and security, privacy and safety.\" **But ultimately, Clinton said she wants tech companies to cooperate with the government. \"Otherwise, law enforcement is blind\u2014blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after,**\" she said.\n\nhttp://gizmodo.com/hillary-clinton-says-she-wants-a-manhattan-project-for-1748920528\n\nhttp://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/hillary-clinton-wants-manhattan-like-project-to-break-encryption/\n\nhttps://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151220/08101633141/hillary-clinton-wants-manhattan-project-encryption-not-back-door-that-makes-no-sense.shtml\n\nhttp://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/12/20/hillary-clinton-calls-for-a-manhattan-project-on-encryption-doesnt-understand-what-a-backdoor-is/\n\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/edward-snowden-clintons-call-for-a-manhattan-like-project-is-terrifying-20151220\n\nhttp://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42921/intelligence/clinton-manhattan-project-encryption.html",

            "body": "I got a shiny new XPS 15 laptop from Dell, and while attempting to troubleshoot a problem, I discovered that it came pre-loaded with a self-signed root CA (Certificate Authority) by the name of [eDellRoot](https://i.imgur.com/DBromxS.png). With it came its private key, marked as non-exportable. However, it is still possible to obtain a raw copy of the private key by using several tools available (I used NCC Group's Jailbreak tool). After briefly discussing this with someone else who had discovered this too, we determined that they are shipping every laptop they distribute with the *exact same root certificate and private key*, very similar to what Superfish did on Lenovo computers. For those that aren't familiar, **this is a major security vulnerability that endangers all recent Dell customers**.\n\nSurely Dell had to have seen what kind of bad press Lenovo got when people discovered what Superfish was up to. Yet, they decided to do the same thing but worse. This isn't even a third-party application that placed it there; it's from Dell's very own bloatware. To add insult to injury, it's not even apparent what purpose the certificate serves. At least with Superfish we knew that their rogue root CA was needed to inject ads into your web pages; the reason Dell's is there is unclear.\n\nIf you have recently bought a Dell computer and want to see if you are affected by this, go to **Start -> type \"certmgr.msc\" -> (accept on UAC prompt) -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates** and check if you have an entry with the name \"eDellRoot\". If so, congratulations, you've been pwned by Dell, the very company you paid for your computer!\n\nHere is a [link to the certificate, private key, and PFX file](https://mega.nz/#F!kwgAQB7K!K6g2PSLyNmpWhQxne5NLfw) for the certificate I found on my machine. The password for the PFX file is \"dell\". (The certificate itself is in the eDellRoot.crt file. Do NOT import the PFX file unless you know what you're doing. I just included it for convenience.) If yours came with the eDellRoot certificate, its thumbprint will probably be:\n\n    98:A0:4E:41:63:35:77:90:C4:A7:9E:6D:71:3F:F0:AF:51:FE:69:27\n\nAnd its serial number:\n\n    6b:c5:7b:95:18:93:aa:97:4b:62:4a:c0:88:fc:3b:b6\n\nIt's upsetting that Dell would do this despite the backlash Lenovo experienced from its customers and the [US Department of Homeland Security](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-051A), and I really hope they quickly do something to correct this. The more people that know and speak up, the faster it will happen.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE:** I've been reading that a lot of people are skeptical in the sense that this CA can't actually do anything because the CA has no capabilities. I did some more research and found out that this CA *can indeed* sign server certificates. I've updated the list of files above to include a certificate issued by the CA with file name \"badgoogle.crt\", which you can also see in [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/T9CnRy6.png). For those that are unfamiliar with how this works, a network attacker could use this CA do sign his or her own fake certificates for use on real websites and an affected Dell user would be none the wiser unless they happened to check the website's certificate chain. This CA could also be used to sign code to run on people's machines, but I haven't tested this out yet.\n\n---\n**UPDATE 2:** Dell has released [a statement](http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/direct2dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2015/11/23/response-to-concerns-regarding-edellroot-certificate) regarding this matter along with instructions for how to remove it ([download](https://dellupdater.dell.com/Downloads/APP009/eDellRootCertRemovalInstructions.docx)).",

            "body": "I know Comcast posts seem like a karma whore topic, but after another user getting national recognition for his troubles I felt compelled to tell everyone my story in hopes it gains some recognition and yet another black eye to Comcast.\n\nComcast caused me to lose my job with a Fortune 100 company. I called them *at least* once a week to fix my internet because I continuously had connectivity issues with my work from home position which caused me to drop from the program I was using. After 4 months with this company they decided to let me go because I would sometimes go *days* with unusable service forcing me to 'call in'. This was me waiting for the next available appointment or waiting on a repeat visit because the first guy couldn't help. You would think I'd be smart enough to switch providers, right? Well, they have a monopoly in my area and its either have internet or don't and I'm not about to sell my house just to dodge them even though it is tempting. To this day I still have connectivity issues 2 years after the fact. I've given up calling at this point because I was going broke from the tech visit fee and getting the fee waived is a hassle in itself because you have to sit on hold and then argue until you're blue in the face. You either waste time, money, or in my case, both.\n\nSide story here. Automated systems are a pain, but did you know Comcast's automated system will never let you talk to tech support if there is a problem in your area? That's dandy when there seemingly is a problem in my area almost every time I call and end up needing a tech out here regardless. I lost count of how many times I've needed a tech at my location, but been denied because of my \"problem area\". I've even called billing to get help and they transfer me back to the automated tech system every time just to have me denied again.\n\n**TL;DR:** Comcast has a monopoly and couldn't fix my internet no matter how many times they tried. Work from home job let me go because I didn't have a reliable connection and Comcast is my ***only*** option. Also read my edits, because even new comments are asking and saying the same things that I've explained.\n\n**EDITS**:\n\nSince the question of why I didn't exercise other options is a common question I'll explain.\n\nI need a dedicated landline because calls were routed from an 800 number to the phone line. They said no VOIP or cellphones. The company also sent you an all in one desktop computer you had to work on. They even turned off the wifi option and wouldn't give you clearance to turn it on if you wanted to so for this job so I couldn't go use wifi somewhere. The closest shared office building would be 120 miles round trip each day and I couldn't afford that on top of the rental fees. I couldn't just up and move either. Just because something is feasible in your mind doesn't mean it is for everyone else. I realize at the end of the day I could have taken out loans or moved, but needing to take such extreme measures due to Comcast's poor service is just insane.\n\nTo those asking why I took a internet heavy job with bad internet, I didn't know it was bad. I had just moved and I primarily browse and download with good speeds. However, my internet apparently drops a lot and you don't really notice that until you need a solid connection for 8-10 hours each day. I'm sure I would have noticed at some point, but what little use I had with it had nothing glaringly wrong until I put it to the test. I had Comcast when I lived in Indy and it was great. It's my own fault for assuming, but I assumed I would get the same level of service\n\nA lot of the same questions are being asked. AT&T does not offer any service to my home. I've called and tried every so often and they just say \"not at this time\" There is literally no other companies that offer internet to my area. Trust me, I've tried. I guess that's hard for some of you to believe, but it's the 100% truth. They service my zip code, but I'm on the ass end of town and they don't service quite that far out even though I'm in the same zip code.\n\nI couldn't use a hotspot due to poor signal at home. I just ran a speed test on my phone and am at 0.11mb/sec. I guess I'm just crazy far from a tower because everyone I know gets little to no service here. I have Sprint, had AT&T until last year, my best friend and his wife have T-Mobile, family members who visit have a mixed bag of Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Cricket and not a single device works well out here. Sprint even gave me a signal booster and it doesn't do shit for me. \n\nI also cannot get satellite because there is no clear path to the southern sky. I've had the techs come out and try, but they say it's just not possible due to the trees. I don't live in BFE because I'm like a 10 minute drive to Best Buy, BWW, Walmart, and all sorts of related places. The town has about 25,000 people, but I live on the outer edge where it's just a dead spot for everything.\n\nYou're all correct in saying I didn't exercise all of my options since I didn't do business class. I'll never know if it would have stayed broken or fixed the issue. A lot of your stories are a mixed bag saying it's reliable and others saying it did nothing for them on business class. In all honesty the only reason I didn't try it because I didn't know it was a feasible option. Comcast never offered or even mentioned it, the company said a business line isn't needed, and I was clueless in regards to the limitations or cost. I assumed it was going to be pricey as I was under the assumption it for actual businesses and was going to be overkill for my needs or overly expensive for a one man operation. I'll have to blame that on my own ignorance.\n\n**I didn't post this for pity and I am not about to sue anyone over anything and have no intention to**. I just wanted to share my horrible Comcast story. Plain and simple. This was 2 years ago now and I have a secure job and a happy family. Comcast is still shitty, but I'm sure you all knew that. You're all correct in saying at the end of the day it's my fault, but I tried my damnedest of everything feasible. I appreciate all the stories and kind words. Some of you are assholes though ;(\n\nThanks for the gold! I've been getting a lot of hate mail from people you could tell didn't read any of my edits. Read, people. I've covered just about everything everyone keeps repeating the same things! Also, I'll say it again. ***A LOT*** of you are assholes.",

No more WikiLeaks, BitTorrent, or Pirate Bay ever again for Americans.They could also employ [proxy filters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Monitoring_and_filtering) and other technologies to accomplish their goals. The [MPAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America) is probably cheering like giddy school girls because of this. Corrupt trigger happy copyright organizations like the IOC and FIFA along with American companies will be able to censor almost any information they want.\n\n\nTo ensure privacy and protect the spread of uncensored information. Data from around the world passes through the US, so restricting the free flow of information will be a significant blow to freedom of speech worldwide. To protect the principles of a modern liberalism that our democracy is based on, information control must be decentralized and not in the hands of a powerful few. \n\n**What we need to do:**\n\nWe need to tell the FCC we don't want net neutrality for \"lawful\" content. We want it for all content to ensure decentralization in our democracy.  \n\nWe need to also tell the FCC that we want net neutrality to apply to all data transmitting companies including mobile providers, backbones, ocean cable operators, and ISPs. No where should a company be allowed to violate net neutrality for the ISPs.",

Here is the direct link to the youtube video showing the result-** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P9WIfGyX-Q&feature=youtu.be\n\nUPDATE: You can find the update here- http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2gixp7/updatetime_warner_is_already_terrible_despite_a/\n\nHaving seen many terrible recordings with Comcast I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to record my own interaction to have a backup of what I was being told. \n\nI was transferred something like eight or nine times, sent to the business class department voicemail for some reason, told to stop recording by a supervisor (who had no answers and told me some...ridiculous things) told opposing things by different reps, and ultimately had a rep admit the letter I was sent was a lie. \n\nHere is a copy of the letter they sent me- http://imgur.com/6Uttmkq\n\nThey ultimately told me to call back to the customer help desk tomorrow, right after the last person tells me the letter is wrong. If anyone ends up caring I will post an update.\n\nHere is the interaction if you would like to see it- Time Warner and Their Crap: http://youtu.be/Xg3IhBraxLM\n\nTL;DR: Time Warner lied in their promotional mailing. A representative admits that to me after being transferred to nine different people who don't know what the hell they are talking about, one being a supervisor who gets a little feisty about being recorded.\n\nEDIT 2: The timeline of the video for those interested in skipping about-\n\n01:26- Terrence gets on the phone and confirms the package for me. Has to transfer me because it lowers my bill.\n\n02:30- PKE boredom.\n\n02:40- The words come out of Terrence's mouth.\n\n03:24- Transferred to Tiara. She denies what Terrence said.\n\n06:22- Tiara wants to confirm with a supervisor.\n\n07:23- I ask to be transferred to a supervisor. Mr. Feisty cometh. He gets mad that I am recording.\n\n11:50- Mr. Feisty transfers me again.\n\n11:55- Cynthia picks up.\n\n12:53- My phone runs out of space and I start recording on my desktop.\n\n16:51- Transferred to someone who does not identify themselves.\n\n20:27- Nameless says she will transfer me to a 'specialist'.\n\n20:33- I find out that I am being transferred to the business class line for some reason. It directs me to a voicemail which tells me to leave a message after the tone. There is no tone.\n\n21:08- I put a shirt on and call back.\n\n21:13- Emily picks up. I explain how I've been bounced around and, essentially, hung up on. \n\n23:39- Emily tells me that I don't have to worry about anyone misspeaking or anything because they too are recording all calls. \n\n25:04- I try to tell Emily that the letter says it is to add TV to my internet service, not about starting new service. She understands. So she says.\n\n25:30- She refers to the fine print possibly saying that it is for new service. Here is a picture of the fine print- http://i.imgur.com/f2Xnm30.jpg\n\n26:10- Transferred to Ricardo, who asks me for an EID number. Tells me I was accidentally transferred to an 'internal department'.\n\n30:47- Ricardo informs me he is going to transfer me again, but with the catch that he is going to explain it to them that I do qualify for the package on the flyer.\n\n31:28- Ricardo comes back to tell me that I actually don't qualify for the package on the flyer.\n\n32:43- I confirm with Ricardo that the letter I was sent was not correct. He says that is true.\n\n33:05- I repeat myself and have him confirm what he just said.\n\n35:10- Ricardo tells me to call back to customer care on monday/tomorrow.\n\n35:59- Ricardo is saying goodbye, and starts laughing for some reason. My final thoughts follow after.\n\n\n",

Couldn't have been happier. The minute that promotional period ended, our service dropped to below 4mbp/s. \n\nI just ran a speed test on [their own speed test site](http://speedtest.comcast.net) and found that we're getting 1.8m service on Ipv4. That means, if we were paying for the service we're receiving, we'd be paying $3/month.\n\nI've called, they've sent the magic signal over and over again, nothing happens. They hung up on me when I tried to schedule service. \n\nI don't know anyone that gets the service they pay for with comcast.\n\nWhere are the consumer protections? Why is no one making this more of an issue? I'm getting ripped off every month and there's no recourse or penalty for the perpetrator. \n\nFuck these guys. \n\nEdit: Wow, got back from an afternoon out (one thing about shitty internet -- you'll go [outside](http://www.reddit.com/r/outside) more), and I'm at the top of r/technology! Well, multiple calls, lots of holding, and I finally got an appointment for a tech to come out and have a look. I'll post an update on Tuesday when I see what comes of it.

            "body": "I think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated R but overall, I still agree with the sentiment. Terminator 2 could not be made today and I think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. \n\nThe common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of \"swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good\". And that would be correct, something being rated R does not inherently make it good or better. But what it DOES add is realism. REAL people swear. Real people bleed. Real people have nipples. R ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. \n\nAlso, and I think this is an even important point, PG-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. Sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. Some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. I think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable. I rarely feel any great sense of emotion. Do you think the T-1000 would have been as iconic of a movie villain if we hadn't seen him stab people through the head with his finger? Probably not. In Robocop, would Murphy's near-death experience have felt as intense had it cut away and not shown him getting filled with lead? Definitely not. Sometimes you NEED that.\n\nI'm not saying everything has to be R. James Bond doesn't have to be R because since day one his movies were meant to be family entertainment and were always PG. Same with Jurassic Park. But the problem is that PG-13 has been used for movies that WEREN'T supposed to be like this. Terminator was never a family movie. Neither was Robocop. They were always dark, intense sci-fi that people loved because it was hardcore and badass. And look what happened to their PG-13 reboots, they were neither hardcore nor badass. \n\nThe most common justification for things not being R is \"they make less money\" but I think this has become a self fulfilling prophecy. Studios assume they'll make less money, so they make less R rated movies, so they're less likely to make money, so then studios make less, and on and on. \n\nBut adjusted for inflation, [Terminator 2 made almost a BILLION dollars.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=520.000%2C000&year1=1991&year2=2015) (the calculator only goes up to 10,000,000 so I had to knock off some zeroes).  \n\n[The Matrix Reloaded made even more.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=742.1&year1=2003&year2=2015) \n\nIf it's part of a franchise we like, people will probably see it anyway. It might lose a slight margin but clearly it's possible to still become a huge hit and have an R rating. \n\nHell, even if it's something we DON'T know about, it can still make money. Nobody cared about the comic that Kingsman was based on but it made a lot of cash anyway. Just imagine if it had actually been part of a previously established franchise, it could have even made more of a killing. In fact, I bet the next one does even better. \n\nAnd Deadpool, who does have a fanbase, is in no way a mainstream hero and was a big gamble. But it's crushing records right now and grossed almost THREE TIMES its meager budget in just a few days. And the only reason it got made to begin with is because of Ryan Reynolds pushing for it and fans demanding it. How many more of these movies could have been made in the past but weren't because of studios not taking risks? Well, THIS risk payed off extremely well. I know Ryan wasn't the only one to make it happen, and I really appreciate whomever made the film a reality, not because it's the best movie ever (it is good though), but because it could represent Hollywood funding more of these kinds of movies. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I really hope these movies are indicative of Hollywood returning to form and taking more risks again. This may be linked to /r/moviescirclejerk, but I don't care, I think it needed to be said. \n\nEDIT: Holy shit, did you people read anything other than the title?

            "body": "I've heard over and over that Vin Diesel and Terry Crews are big nerds who play D&D. I've even heard they play together. Mr. Diesel also seems to have a lot of input into his movies, even having directed a few video games himself. I think with those two in there, there is the making of a phenomenal movie that alternates between a group of friends playing D&D around a table that then has each of those actors playing their characters. Vin plays his character, Terry plays his, the others play their own. Whoever is DMing is also the narrator, and also plays all of the bad guys. \n\nIt opens like it's an actual fantasy movie: Robert Downy Jr. (because that's who I picture in my head, I don't know if he's ever done anything like D&D) is narrating something about our heroes journey, describing them each and how they came together, and the camera pans over a fantasy village. In walks, in fantasy costume, Terry Crews, Vin Diesel, The Rock, Matt Damon, and Patton Oswalt. Patton could play the halfling bard (who wouldn't want to hear him sing?), Matt Damon plays an annoying min-maxing elf who takes too long to do the math and doesn't role-play enough (when his character speaks, he sounds \"out of place\", think when a character talks in \"Drunk History\"), and The Rock could be \"the new guy\" (playing an ironically physically weak wizard) at the table to guide the viewer through some of the basics. His charater is still jacked, but he can't do something simple like push a small boulder or lift a tiny wooden cart because his strength stat is 8. \n\nAt the end of the introduction, Terry Crews objects to the description of what he is wearing. It cuts to a big table at one of their houses, everyone sitting around with their character sheets, the board in the middle has their pieces on a graph sheet. Dice everywhere. RDJ has his secret divider set up and the rule-book out in front of them, and they argue about their starting equipment for a minute. RDJ finally caves and it cuts back to the characters, and Terry's character is wearing the \"correct\" armor now. \n\nI would love to see that. The fantasy parts would be taken seriously like it's an acted out D&D campaign, but it also has the realistic out-of-character relationships and discussions that make up a really important part of any campaign with friends. Plus, I want to see Terry Crews roll a dice, get a perfect 20 and get really excited and start yelling, then cut to Crews in full body armor swinging a broadsword and chopping off an ogre's head in one blow and still yelling, then cutting back to Crews IRL again standing up, yelling, then looking around awkwardly and realizing he got too excited. \n\nEvery villian would be the DM (RDJ again I think just fits, he's just smug and arrogant but also friendly enough), the Ogre is a CGI RDJ, the thief in the hood is him, the big bad monster at the end has his voice. And of course, he's also the narrator. It has comedic potential, it has flashy action and CGI, it has big-name actors doing something ironically nerdy but somehow believable. I think it would make money, what with Hollywoods insistence on making a movie adaptation of everything, but I don't see a D&D movie ever working without acknowledging that it's all still \"pretend\" on some level. Everyone knows D&D, and I read recently that its use in \"Stranger Things\" has led to an increase in sales of D&D stuff lately, so the timing is perfect, too!",

            "body": "I don't know if this was posted somewhere before, but years ago I decided to not watch trailers specifically because they were ruining movies for me one way or another. Growing up trailers were my favorite thing. I loved being hyped for a movie to come out. However, numerous times trailers have spoilers for movies coming out. Even if the trailer doesn't have a \"spoiler\" it can have a scene from the end of the movie that you're waiting for that can count as a spoiler. An example without trying to do a spoiler in an actual movie is that you see a character from the movie that does something you haven't seen yet, but they just had a scene where they are supposed to be dead and now you know they aren't because they haven't done the scene from the trailer yet. \n\n\nSpoilers aside a lot of times people who do the trailer portray the movie incorrectly then how you do once you watch the movie. This causes you to go into the movie with a preconceived notion that the movie is about X and really it's about Y, but thinking it was about X makes you not enjoy the movie. A good example of this, for me personally and all my friends, was watchmen. That was one of the last trailers I watched and without having read the comics just judging by the trailer I thought it was going to be non stop action. \n\n\nAfter only watching movies based on titles/actors/posters it has dramatically increased my movie watching experience. You let the movie tell you the story without trying to make it fit your mindset of what it should be based on the trailer. Also, try to avoid reviews. A lot of reviews are from people who don't have the same likes and dislikes as you, but thinking a movie sucks because you read a bunch of people hating it can make you try to focus on all the negatives on the movie. \n\ntl;dr Try watching movies without seeing an reviews or trailers on it. You'll likely enjoy it much more.",

            "body": "Just think about it. Almost all blockbusters use the orphan trope or the chosen one trope. A lot of the time they use both. MIB did neither.\n\nWill Smith was not picked because he was a chosen one prophesied to defend earth against the aliens. He didn't decide to say yes because some inspirational quote his dead brother told him instilled a certain set of values in him. He was offered a chance because he was a good cop. They picked him because he showed the most skill in their testing scenarios. And he joined because he wanted to. \n\nIn fact, after three movies we still know next to nothing about their lives before joining. J was a cop. That's literally all we know. In the third we found out he grew up without a dad, but it had zero relevance to the story until the third one and wasn't his motivation. In the first one, all of his characterization was purely based around his personality and interaction with others, his backstory was completely nonexistent. \n\nK had a wife. That's the extent of his backstory even after three movies. \n\n\nIsn't this kinda cool, when you really think about it? It's way less cliche, and prophecies are now so overused that they no longer carry weight. And the fact that we bonded with the characters so much, purely based on their personalities, just shows how great the writing and acting was. It feels cheap to get an audience to connect with someone using the death of other characters or some kind of other complicated backstory. \n\nI guarantee if you put the story in less competent hands they would have done all this. \n\nEDIT: All you people asking if I've seen the third one obviously read nothing past the title lmao. \n\nEDIT 2: ALSO, as many have pointed out, his mind was wiped and therefore had no recollection of his dad's death. So that couldn't have affected his decisions. You could argue that it influenced K to select him, but the movie never outright said this.\n\nEDIT 3: This is specifically talking about fantasy/adventure/blockbuster movies. I'm aware not every movie ever made follows these tropes, lord. \n\nEDIT 4: Huh, gilded. Neat. Thanks whoever you are. I now have as many oscars as Leo. ",

            "body": "I don't go to the movies too terribly often, maybe 5-10 times a year, but it seems like the span between the time on your ticket stub to the time the movie is actually starting is getting increasingly large.\n\nI went to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 last night (only a few issues, otherwise a lot of fun and worth the ticket) at 7pm. At 7:00, the trailers began. If I am remembering correctly, the trailers that played were Transformers, Spider Man, Thor, Wonder Woman, Valerian, The Mummy, Kingsman, and Star Wars. I may be forgetting one, but at least those 8 trailers played. Each trailer had this stupid screen afterwards reminding us to make sure we see it in their super awesome extreme mega-badass theater (whatever it's called).\n\nAfter the trailers, there was your usual couple of ads telling you to turn off your phone followed by an annoyingly lengthy ad telling us how great the theater is that we are currently sitting in, followed by one of those needlessly long sound test ads (I miss you THX), followed by a final ad telling everyone to enjoy the movie. Towards the end of all this, you could tell that the audience was getting impatient, and there were several audible sighs and other comments.\n\nWhen the little Marvel Studios animation started, I checked the time. 7:32. We had all just sat through 32 minutes of what are essentially ads. Now don't get me wrong, I love trailers and look forward to seeing a few, but 8+ trailers followed by like 5-10 minutes of extraneous advertising felt exhausting and ridiculous. Maybe I should stop watching the trailers when they show up here on Reddit? Maybe I should be one of those people and show up late to the movie? I'm not sure. I don't imagine every theater is the same experience, but I can assume most big theater chains have the same policy.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to rant a bit.\n\nEDIT: Just to address some common responses:\n\n * This was a Cinemark in Texas.\n * I like showing up early because I get all anxious about having a good seat. If I can buy reserved seating, I'll always pick that option.\n * 5 to 10 movie visits a year is probably too high an estimate for me. I always THINK I will go see a movie, and don't end up doing it. 3-5 visits a year is probably more accurate for me and even that is apparently more frequent than your average redditor. Could be worth a [strawpoll](http://www.strawpoll.me/12916839).\n\nEDIT 2: Added Kingsman to the trailer list. That was the 8th trailer I forgot about.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Fixed a typo. Also thanks to everyone for the discussion and participating in the poll. The results were somewhat expected, but it's still nice to see.\n",

These are the sort of films that dont really make that kind of money,yet all these films are very successful considering they are more or less serious dramas. Other movie star who previously refrained from franchises, have all joined them. It is not wrong to do so, but these are safer bets as compared to original movies.Washington is also in this category now as he is doing Equalizer 2. \n\nTherefore, I feel Dicaprio deserves credit for making a big name for himself while doing original films every time.

Liver, beans, wine.\n\nLecter is a) cracking a joke for his own amusement, and b) saying he's not taking his meds.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!

I fucking wish more movies would put something like that at the end as it would help those of us cleaning a ton.\n\nEdit: I may be a little salty because I just got finished cleaning theaters for 5 hours.\n\nEdit 2: Wake up to front page, gold, and I destroyed inbox. Thanks reddit!\n\nLast edit: Common complaint is \"You'd be out of a job\". No I wouldn't. There's still going to be popcorn kernels on the floor, a spill of soda, and skittles on the staircase. All I'm asking is grab your bag and drink. Also, ushers do more than just clean the theaters. They stock bathrooms, keep hallways clean, let in lines etc. I'd be anything but out of a job.

This is a genuine unreleased Adam West film with < 100 views on YouTube. Here's the synopsis, from my friend:\n\n[Seance (a.k.a. Killer in the Dark)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UVOj237gi9I)   \n\nStarring: Corey Feldman, Adam West, Mikki Padilla    \n\nSynopsis: Six friends thought it would be \u201ccool\u201d to have a seance, but then something went terribly wrong.     \n\nExecutive Producer: Rick Vasquez   \n\n\u201cSeance\u201d (aka Killer in the Dark) was and produced by Rick Vasquez. It was filmed in the year 2001 (entirely in the Antelope Valley!) with an intended theatrical or DVD release, but was lost in distribution hell. Finally,14 years later, it is viewable for the first time ever on YouTube.\nRick worked on this film for many years and would love to share it with as many people as possible.\n\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT6AdMsjgI0    \n\n\u201cCorey is believable, sensitive, exceptional performance. It is the best film Corey Feldman has ever done.\u201d - R. Vasquez     \n\n\u201cWe called Adam [West] \u2018one-shot Adam\u2019 because he could do every take perfectly in one shot. Everyone\u2019s childhood hero became our hero on set.\u201d - R. Vasquez     \n\nThe script and movie are based on Rick and his brother\u2019s own experience with a ghost in their childhood.    \n\nAll 10 parts can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYVwCjPGnYeoLYM3uagDi6T1WbDo_ylGT) on YouTube.\"\n\nEdit: /u/griffinilla is my good friend who is associated with the film, he is in the comments doing an AMA and has requested I post the IMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286055/",

Like Tangled and Frozen it subverted many princess movie tropes. \n\nCoincidentally they were both released in the same year, so they must have been in production around the same time.\n\nJust a thought I had. \n\nEdit: For those confused, the big Walt Disney Corporation owns both Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios.",

So first off the numbers. The film opened at #1 with ~$100.5M~ $103.1M domestic and $223M worldwide. As mentioned above one of the big elements of this film is that it is the first theatrical film from acclaimed director Patty Jenkins in 13 years and as a female director in charge of this massive film it means she just broke pretty much every conceivable opening weekend record for a female director. Those records including biggest opening previews ($11M beating out Fifty Shade of Grey's $8.6M), biggest Friday ($38M beating out Twilight's $35M), and biggest overall weekend ($103.1M beating out Fifty Shades of Grey's $85.1M and for added bonus its 4 day $93M haul). It also had the highest worldwide opening ever for a female director and the biggest opening in China for a female director as well ($38M). So yes an unbelievable performance on that level but where it completely demolished was in comparison with other female superhero films, where let's face it the competition was laughable. The highest opening weekend for a female superhero film before this was Catwoman (BoxOfficeMojo lists Ghost in the Shell as a superhero film so therefore it had the highest opening for a female led superhero movie which I just personally disagree with completely) which opened with $16.7M. In fact Wonder Woman almost made more than the entire lifetime domestic gross of Catwoman ($40.2M) in just it's opening day. So yeah weak competition for sure, but even so this is a major boon for female lead superhero film as not only did the film surpass domestic expectations (WB predicted the film opening around $55M-$65M) but it excelled overseas with the 4th biggest opening for WB in that country. Okay so let's face it, the amount of female directors helming major franchises is pathetic so while certainly Jenkins and WB's achievements here should be heralded as I noted the competition is a little weak. No let's get to the juiciest comparisons, comparing it to other recent superhero premiere films where I can report it also crushed it. The film's opening not only surpassed the openings of recent superhero origin films like Doctor Strange ($85M), Ant-Man ($57.2M), and X-Men Origins: Wolverine ($85M), it even passed Guardians of the Galaxy ($94.3M) and Iron Man ($98.6M). That's an incredible performance, especially for a film without a major star (Gal certainly isn't unknown but hasn't been the main lead of a major film). In terms of solo superhero origin movies, it is now #4 behind Deadpool, Man of Steel, and Spider-Man in opening numbers. In terms of worldwide releases, Wonder Woman not only passed Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy it also passed those films *sequels'* worldwide openings as well. So now to the final comparison, the DCEU itself which actually is the one place Wonder Woman could look like a downsize as it had the worst opening yet for a DCEU film. Now a couple things there. One, the only real comparison would be Man of Steel, which by the way cost $125M more to make and opened just $13M more over Wonder Woman. Second, as mentioned before WB was expecting the film to open almost half what it did so there really is no concern on WB's end here. Third, holy shit DC have opened 4 movies in a row to over $100M. That's seriously incredible and with Justice League in November they could easily go 5 for 5. Honestly WB/DC deserves some serious credit for that, as even Marvel haven't come close to that record. Now while Wonder Woman opened lower than the previous 3 films it does have a chance to overtake those films as we face the looming question of can WW break the DC legs curse. As notably and controversially mentioned previously on this write-up series (seriously someone tagged me just this week to yell at me again about this) I think the DC films have had weak legs. While Suicide Squad's and Man of Steel's are arguable, it's certainly obvious for Batman v Superman which has the worst weekend opening multiplier ever for a film opening over $100M. The good news for Wonder Woman is that the film is easily the best rated DCEU film by a mile. It not only is the first film of the franchise to be Certified Fresh on RottenTomatoes but it is one of the best reviewed superhero films ever. It also received the best Cinemascore ranking of the franchise, an A rating which could give it a long life. However the next three critical weekends do face possible stiff competition. Next weekend will be the release of The Mummy, then Cars 3, and then finally Transformers 5. All of these could take up different quadrants of the potential audience for the film. However Wonder Woman is playing to a largely adult female audience (55%, usually superhero films have about 45% of audience female) and that group could keep the film afloat in the weeks to come. At the very least the opening weekend is a triumph on many levels and hopefully just these numbers alone will help break outdated ideas of who can make a movie, who can star in one, what the film can be about, and who the film can be for. \n\n* It seems that now Dreamworks is also trying the Illumination formula as **Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie** opened to a weak $23.5M but on a budget of just $38M. It's clear a big influence on this film was the rise of Illumination who've been making animated film that cost half of what a usual Pixar or Dreamworks film cost and now Captain Underpants cost almost half of those budgets which are around $75M-$85M. As such it seems on paper that this opening was a disaster, as it's in the bottom third of Dreamworks films openings. But compare it to a film with a similar opening, Rise of the Guardians which opened to a similar $23.7M on a budget that cost over $100M more than Captain Underpants. However what Guardians did have was a strong foreign release where the film grossed over $200M, and in that Captain Underpants may suffer as it opened in eight territories to just $700K. Still with such a low budget Captain Underpants could be a minor hit if movies like Cars 3 don't make it drop like a stone. Looking at the upcoming slate it doesn't seem like Dreamworks will repeat this experiment any time soon, as even something as cartoonish as Baby Boss cost $125M and the original Captain Underpants books' crude artwork made it easy to translate into a less rendered and fleshed out world. Still it'll be interesting to watch this film as time goes on and see how a cheaper version of Dreamworks animation fares in the long run. \n\n\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\n\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren't in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

            "body": "When we first meet King Schultz, he\u2019s a larger-than-life figure \u2013 a cocky,  European version of Clint Eastwood\u2019s Man with No Name. On no less than three occasions, stupid fucking rednecks step to him, and he puts them down without breaking a sweat. But in retrospect, he\u2019s not nearly as badass as we\u2019re led to believe. At the end of the movie, King is dead, and Django is the one strutting away like Clint Eastwood. \n\nI mean, we like King. He\u2019s cool, he kills the bad guy. He rescues Django from slavery. He hates racism. He\u2019s a good guy. But he\u2019s also incredibly arrogant and smug. He thinks he knows everything. Slavery offends him, like a bad odor, but it doesn\u2019t outrage him. It\u2019s all a joke to him, he just waves it off. His philosophy is the inverse of Dark Helmet\u2019s: Good will win because evil is dumb. The world doesn\u2019t work like that.\n\nKing\u2019s plan to infiltrate Candyland is stupid. There had to be an easier way to save Hildy. I\u2019ve seen some people criticize this as a contrivance on Tarantino\u2019s part, but it seems perfectly in character to me. Schultz comes up with this convoluted con job, basically because he wants to play a prank on Candie. It\u2019s a plan made by someone whose intelligence and skills have sheltered him from ever being really challenged. This is why Django can keep up his poker face and King finds it harder and harder. He\u2019s never really looked that closely at slavery or its brutality; he\u2019s stepped in, shot some idiots and walked away. \n\nCandie\u2019s victory shatters his illusions, his wall of irony. The world isn\u2019t funny anymore, and good doesn\u2019t always triumph anymore, and stupid doesn't always lose anymore, and Schultz couldn\u2019t handle that. This is why Candie\u2019s European pretensions eat at him so much, why he can\u2019t handle Candie\u2019s sister defiling his country\u2019s national hero Beethoven with her dirty slaver hands. His murder of Candie is his final act of arrogance, one last attempt at retaining his superiority, and one that costs him his life and nearly dooms his friends. Django would have had no problem walking away broke and outsmarted. He understands that the system is fucked. He can look at it without flinching.\n\nBut Schultz does go out with one final victory, and it isn\u2019t murdering Candie; It\u2019s the conversation about Alexandre Dumas. Candie thinks Schultz is being a sore loser, and he\u2019s not wrong, but it\u2019s a lot more than that. It\u2019s because Candie is not a worthy opponent; he\u2019s just a dumb thug given power by a broken system. That\u2019s what the Dumas conversation is about; it\u2019s Schultz saying to Candie directly, \u201cYou\u2019re not cool, you\u2019re not smart, you\u2019re not sophisticated, you\u2019re just a *piece of shit* and no matter how thoroughly you defeated me, you are never going to get anything from me but contempt.\u201d \n\nAnd that does make me feel better. No matter how much trouble it caused Django in the end, it comforts me to think that Calvin died knowing that he wasn\u2019t anything but a piece of shit. \n\n",

Say how they would film a thriller, horror, action or comedy. \n\nedit: Fuck me this blew up overnight.

This one does not. And I'm not saying cell phone use has increased because of the switch, but in every single film that I've been to in the last year or so, it's been a much bigger issue than it had been before. Outside of the cell phone thing, this ad just does not do a good job of preparing you for your movie experience. Nothing says \"get ready for the gritty, dark, emotionally devastating world of Logan\" like a bunch of teens singing loudly and flinging around popcorn at each other. This ad feels like the final obstacle you have to face before you're allowed to see your film. \n\nEDIT: Clarifying that the one they show is a condensed thirty second version. Still just as excruciating.\n\nEDIT 2: Two months later, the ad is removed and replaced! Follow up: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/69j8f5/a_thank_you_to_cinemark_theatres_and_to_reddit/\n",

            "body": "So I never had the fortune of watching this movie until my fiancee showed it to me on Saturday.  While it was surprising in many ways (including how easily the characters shrugged off internet infidelity) I think the most shocking was how strongly I was reminded of pre-9/11 life.  It's not just the nostalgia factor of dial-up or AOL screen names or the concept of chatrooms (which I never realized completely disappeared). It was that the Yuppie lifestyle was in full-speed-ahead mode.  Starbucks was still trendy; that little bit about defining self through the coffee you order?  That was true.  Hipsters have absolutely nothing on the 1990's high-powered executive. Back then, Starbucks introduced the very idea of your coffee being a part of identity Now we're so saturated with personal choice that no one cares what monks picked your coffee beans from which mountain range under what cycle of the moon. It's almost passe now.\n\nThere was no weary cynicism towards capitalism.  In fact, it reads like a love letter penned to it.  The executive gets the girl in the end.  He steals her from a pointedly leftist columnist who in turn finds HIMself attracted to a philanthropist that is part of the New York bourgeois.  This is after Hanks shuts down a shop that was her family's business so his father's superstore can cut a tiny sliver more profit.  If that plot doesn't seem like a Libertarian fantasy, I don't know what does.\n\nIt just struck me as odd that this was life only 15 years ago.  While technology has obviously advanced I think the culture of American life has changed as much, if not more.",

There are some great ones, like Tony Stark as Iron Man, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Wesley Snipes as Blade, etc. Most of us can't separate the characters and the actors now. But no matter how great they are, Patrick Stewart as professor X is different. It's like the creators in the 1960s went forward in time and based the character off Stewart. Most actors have to mold the character around them or become the character. Ian Mckellen as Gandalf is a good example. Ian Mckellen personally seems nothing like Gandalf in his regular life, but he became the iconic portrayal of that character. Patrick Stewart IS professor X. He looks exactly like him. He has that stoic look, the wisdom, the accent, the class, the commanding presence, and everything. I can't think of a character/actor match as good in nearly any medium. ",

YOU CAN FIND THE CHANGES (AND REASONING)** [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3hbiio/update_1001_greatest_movies_of_all_time_plus/)\n\n\nSo over the past few months I have been carefully creating a system using the most popular movie rating systems available online, as well as general movie data, to determine the greatest movies of all time.  \n  \nI started off by gathering ratings from **IMDB (User/Critic Average), Rotten Tomatoes (Tomatometer, Critic Average, Audience Score, User Average), Metacritic (Critic Average, User Average) and Letterboxd (User Average).** I was then able to determine a rating (out of 10) for each individual rating and therefore come up with an average rating for each site. Each site\u2019s average rating was then weighted fairly so that no site\u2019s ratings were favored above the rest.  \nThe next step was to make sure that each film was treated fairly. Other top movie list\u2019s like IMDb\u2019s Top 250 removes films that have under a certain viewing number (25,000 I think), but rather than ruling out films that may have been overlooked by the general audience (especially older films), I opted to alter these films score by carefully deducting points depending on how many people have seen it, and therefore voted on it. I also thought it was needed to make sure that recent films (released within the past 36 months) were also not favored, as it usually takes 3 years for the average rating to settle down. So I also added a deduction to these films that fell under this rule.  \n  \nThis process took a lot of tweaking to get right, but I am more than happy with the final result. Hopefully you all are to.  \n  \n***NOTE:*** As I went over Reddit\u2019s maximum character limit trying to show you the full 1001 movie list, I have opted to show you the first 250 movies.   \n\n**You can find the full 1001 Movie list in the following online lists, as well as a list outlining the available films on NETFLIX (US):** \n \n[iCheckMovies: 1001 Greatest Movies of All Time](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/top10ners+1001+greatest+movies+of+all+time/top10ner/)  \n[Letterboxd: 1001 Greatest Movies of All Time](http://letterboxd.com/top10ner/list/top10ners-1001-greatest-movies-of-all-time/)  \n[IMDb: 1001 Greatest Movies of All Time](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls074674014/)  \n  \n**ANYWAY, without further ado, I present you the 250(of 1001) Greatest Movies of All Time:**\n\nRank | Title | Year | Director |\n---|---|----|----|----\n1\t|\tThe Godfather\t|\t1972\t|\tFrancis Ford Coppola\n2\t|\tSeven Samurai\t|\t1954\t|\tAkira Kurosawa\n3\t|\tThe Godfather: Part II\t|\t1974\t|\tFrancis Ford Coppola\n4\t|\tPulp Fiction\t|\t1994\t|\tQuentin Tarantino\n5\t|\t12 Angry Men\t|\t1957\t|\tSidney Lumet\n6\t|\tThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\t|\t1966\t|\tSergio Leone\n7\t|\tThe Shawshank Redemption\t|\t1994\t|\tFrank Darabont\n8\t|\tSunset Blvd.\t|\t1950\t|\tBilly Wilder\n9\t|\tSchindler's List\t|\t1993\t|\tSteven Spielberg\n10\t|\tSpirited Away\t|\t2001\t|\tHayao Miyazaki\n11\t|\tModern Times\t|\t1936\t|\tCharlie Chaplin\n12\t|\tCity Lights\t|\t1931\t|\tCharles Chaplin\n13\t|\tGoodfellas\t|\t1990\t|\tMartin Scorsese\n14\t|\tM\t|\t1931\t|\tFritz Lang\n15\t|\tDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\t|\t1964\t|\tStanley Kubrick\n16\t|\tOnce Upon a Time in the West\t|\t1968\t|\tSergio Leone\n17\t|\tLawrence of Arabia\t|\t1962\t|\tDavid Lean\n18\t|\tRear Window\t|\t1954\t|\tAlfred Hitchcock\n19\t|\tThe Dark Knight\t|\t2008\t|\tChristopher Nolan\n20\t|\tStar Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\t|\t1980\t|\tIrvin Kershner\n21\t|\tCasablanca\t|\t1942\t|\tMichael Curtiz\n22\t|\tApocalypse Now\t|\t1979\t|\tFrancis Coppola\n23\t|\tOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\t|\t1975\t|\tMilos Forman\n24\t|\tRashomon\t|\t1950\t|\tAkira Kurosawa\n25\t|\tTaxi Driver\t|\t1976\t|\tMartin Scorsese\n26\t|\tA Separation\t|\t2011\t|\tAsghar Farhadi\n27\t|\tThe 400 Blows\t|\t1959\t|\tFran\u00c3\u00a7ois Truffaut\n28\t|\tThe Third Man\t|\t1949\t|\tCarol Reed\n29\t|\tPaths of Glory\t|\t1957\t|\tStanley Kubrick\n30\t|\tBicycle Thieves\t|\t1948\t|\tVittorio De Sica\n31\t|\tGrave of the Fireflies\t|\t1988\t|\tIsao Takahata\n32\t|\tRaiders of the Lost Ark\t|\t1981\t|\tSteven Spielberg\n33\t|\tIkiru\t|\t1952\t|\tAkira Kurosawa\n34\t|\tCitizen Kane\t|\t1941\t|\tOrson Welles\n35\t|\tPersona\t|\t1966\t|\tIngmar Bergman\n36\t|\tChinatown\t|\t1974\t|\tRoman Polanski\n37\t|\tThe Night of the Hunter\t|\t1955\t|\tCharles Laughton\n38\t|\tYojimbo\t|\t1961\t|\tAkira Kurosawa\n39\t|\tDouble Indemnity\t|\t1944\t|\tBilly Wilder\n40\t|\tPsycho\t|\t1960\t|\tAlfred Hitchcock\n41\t|\tVertigo\t|\t1958\t|\tAlfred Hitchcock\n42\t|\tStalker\t|\t1979\t|\tAndrey Tarkovskiy\n43\t|\tSingin' in the Rain\t|\t1952\t|\tStanley Donen, Gene Kelly\n44\t|\tMetropolis\t|\t1927\t|\tFritz Lang\n45\t|\tAll About Eve\t|\t1950\t|\tJoseph L.

There is obviously some tension amongst the Batmens, Christian Bale and Michael Keaton are getting too much attention. No one realised Will Arnett was Batman in the Lego Movie and he\u2019s desperately trying to convince the punters. Adam West is senile and doesn\u2019t ever remember being batman. Ben Affleck is given shit for being the newbie. Val Kilmer is happy just to be there.\n\nThen Comic-Con is over run with Terrorists and its up to the Batmens to put aside their differences, team up and save the day.\n\nTell me you wouldn\u2019t watch that.\n\nEDIT: Holy snapping duck balls Batman. For an off the cuff post this went nuts. 3 x Gold is something of an embarrassment but thanks to all who contributed. So a couple of points.\n\n1) Yes, I left Clooney out, all though I did say 'Everyone who has ever been Batman' so...\n\n2) No, the title is 'Batmens'. Whats better than Batman? Batmen. What's better that Batmen? Batmens!\n\n3) To the several dozen people who explicitly told me 'I wouldn't watch that'. Congratulations, you passed the test. Please go and wait at your front door, a limo will be there to collect you soon.\n\n4) Some of you guys seem kind of angry.

I told him I love the \"gratuitous motion\" in his films; instead of every movement being dictated by the story, sometimes people will just sit for a moment, or sigh, or gaze at a running stream, or do something extra, not to advance the story but only to give the sense of time and place and who they are. \"We have a word for that in Japanese,\" he said. \"It's called 'ma.' Emptiness. It's there intentionally.\" He clapped his hands three or four times. \"The time in between my clapping is 'ma.' If you just have non-stop action with no breathing space at all, it's just busyness.\n\nI've sort of given up on most blockbuster action movies recently because a lot of them just go from one action sequence to another without taking a break. And this is praised by critics as \"fast paced\" and \"mile-a-minute\" and \"action packed,\" but I come away without having given a chance to immerse myself in the world of the movie. It just feels like I'm bombarded by mindless action that I'm supposed to appreciate, without being given a reason to. \n\nI love it when movies have those moments of emptiness. When they slow down to really let you into their world, and let you take in what has just happened. When they linger for a while in the eye of the storm. You need that.",

It's got Adam West\n\n4. Most movies that go to the future are only ok, the future in this movie is colorful and engaging.\n\n5. Finally, the message, I love the message that u cannot focus on yesterday but look to tommorow, it's something that people should do more. They worry about failing yesterday and only focus on that when they can move to tommorow and can succeed.\n\nI would go check this film out, it is very underrated.\n\nEdit:Wow!!!! A 1000 upvotes!!!! I never thought this post would get so much attention! Thank you and keep moving forward!\n\nEdit: 10000!

First up, this plus the $118.7 mil Strange earned overseas has pushed Disney's worldwide gross to over $6 bil, the second time ever for a studio (last year Universal made $6.98 bil). Keep in mind Moana still has the prime 5 day Thanksgiving slot ahead as well as the upcoming ultimate test for just how damn popular the Star Wars brand is with Rogue One, so Disney way well become the first to pass $7 bil. It wasn't just Disney records with Strange, as this is the 14th MCU film to premiere at #1 that means the MCU films are now tied with the Pixar brand for the most consecutive #1 premieres in a row. That means if Guardians of the Galaxy 2 premieres at #1 Marvel will clinch the record for good as while Inside Out did have an incredible opening it stopped the Pixar #1 premiere record by premiering at #2 against the insane juggernaut that was Jurassic World. However these are just nominal awards so let's talk about the actual success of Doctor Strange. The film was the second best solo origin film for Marvel behind Iron Man and the 8th best comic book origin story opening of any kind. The film did very well on IMAX, the biggest IMAX release ever which brought in $24.2 mil worldwide this weekend. 3D was also a a big as 45% of Doctor Strange sales this week were in 3D. The real surprise was China, where the film opened to $44.3 mil mostly due to the apparent huge popularity of Benedict Cumberbatch and his show Sherlock over there. That's actually the third best MCU Chinese opening behind Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War, so expect very big things for the film there. Domestically, Doctor Strange should hold very well with little competition and an A on Cinemascore but Moana should slow it down by the end of the month. Still the film should easily clear $200 mil domestic by the end of its run and marks yet another major success for Marvel. \n\n* Maybe it's the popularity of the Justin Timberlake song, the lack of recent animated kids films, or people still remember the dolls but **Trolls** surpassed expectations coming at #2 with $45.6 mil. Last year saw the release of The Peanuts Movie in the same slot and Trolls performed about the same. Trolls does have some breathing room in its odd Novemeber slot as the only new colorful kids film option before Moana takes that all away. Helping the film is certainly the impressive international appeal where the film has earned $104 mil so far, especially with good showings in France and UK. While the film probably isn't looking at a massive success it will likely clear $300 mil worldwide and could hold well with its A Cinemascore. \n\n* While critics and audience reviews have embraced the return of Mel Gibson, the box office didn't translate as **Hacksaw Ridge** came in at #3 with a disappointing $14.7 mil. It's hard to pin down exactly why the film received very good reviews yet couldn't translate to box office. The most obvious could be Mel himself, who's still closely associated with the defaming remarks he made several years ago. The marketing in the US notably left off Mel's name in the posters and trailers but it's hard to know if public rejected it because of Mel or because they didn't know it was by Mel. A more sociopolitical reason may be that in the final throes of a bitter election most people wanted escapism with singing trolls and magic wizards than bloody violent war. Perhaps the most likely though is that old eternal boogeyman, the marketing which was fairly absent and perhaps so worried about the association with Mel downplayed the main character's important religious beliefs which may have brought out a Christian audience. The bright spot for Hacksaw though may be what little audience it had which was almost primarily over the age of 35 and gave the film an A on Cinemascore (it was a great weekend at the movies according to that poll), which could help the film have decent legs. Still this probably isn't the major comeback Gibson was probably hoping for and any possible Oscar noms will come too late to help. \n\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\n\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren't in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

Plus the idea of walking around a dark, underground, Egyptian Temple with him in the shadows is fucking scary.  Arnold Vosloo was perfect for the role.  I love the idea how he's brought back to life and through out the film he has to suck peoples fluids and organs to fully regenerates himself.  So many films show people rising from the dead and they're exactly the same as they were before, I felt Imhotep actually had to work at fully coming back.   ",

            "body": "Hi, this is Jon Favreau.    \nThanks to all of you who came out to see the Jungle Book.  Its warm reception around the world is extremely appreciated. Thank you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI\u2019m posting because a lot of people are asking which of the seemingly endless list of formats I recommend to see the movie in. Let me start by saying that the answer\u2019s different for everybody so I\u2019ll try to cover as thoroughly as possible what the best thing is for each taste.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is a very exciting new technology out there right now, and Jungle Book is the first film that has been released in the format. It\u2019s called **Dolby Vision 3D**.  Unfortunately, there are only a handful of theaters that have it.  It\u2019s a laser projection system with extended dynamic range. The black levels on the screen are extremely deep, the contrast levels are much higher and the brightness of the screen make for a 3D experience where the glasses disappear.  I think this technology is a game-changer and I applaud Dolby for this breakthrough and look forward to it being more widely available.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are the places where it\u2019s currently available:    \n**Los Angeles:** El Capitan Theatre    \n**New York:** AMC Empire 25    \n**Chicago Area:** AMC Hawthorn 12    \n\n&nbsp;\n\nInternationally- Four locations:    \n**Two in The Netherlands** (JT Eindhoven & JT Hilversum)    \nCinesa La Maquinista in **Barcelona**    \nThe Cinelpexx in **Linz, Austria**    \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can find out more about it here: http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-cinema/the-jungle-book.html\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the big-screen format, **IMAX** has a laser projection system that\u2019s extremely robust and many people that I talk to consider this their top choice.  If you want a more intense experience with a clean bright image and the cutting edge IMAX sound system, then this is a great way to go.  Although the black levels are not as true as the Dolby Vision, the laser projection counteracts the dimming effect of the 3D glasses and I think it is a fantastic premium way to see it that I highly recommend.  If you haven\u2019t checked out **IMAX with laser**, you should definitely give it a shot.    \nUnfortunately, there are relatively few locations of these projection systems around the world. IMAX has made it easy to find them through this site: http://www.imax.com/news/experience-jungle-book-imax-laser\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother format that I am very impressed with is **Cinemark Ultra 3D**. It boasts an extremely bright image that counteracts any dimming associated with traditional 3D. My experience is that the screen size is impressive and the quality is very high. Again, another great choice but not yet widely available. Here\u2019s a link to their current locations: http://www.cinemark.com/cinemark-ultra-3d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**RealD** is the most common 3D format and they have an exciting new technology to offer as well. The **Ultimate Screen** is available in a few theaters and is designed to deliver a brighter and more uniform image. This means that the dimming effect from the glasses should not be a factor. There is also no hot spot often associated with silver screens used in 3D and the image should be more uniform regardless of seat location.  You can read more about the Ultimate Screen here: https://www.reald.com/#/ultimatescreen    \nHere are the current theaters where you can see Ultimate Screen:    \n**Burbank, CA** \u2013 AMC Burbank 16 \u2013 Auditorium 7    \n**Boulder, CO** \u2013 Century Boulder \u2013 29th St Auditorium 8 & 11    \n**Beijing, China** \u2013 Wanda Plaza \u2013 Auditorium 5\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom here on it\u2019s a matter of personal preference.  **Standard IMAX 3D** has the advantage of a larger screen and many locations.  The key here is to pick your seats wisely.  The closer you are to the projector, the better your experience is going to be.  I would be careful in any 3D environment not to be in the front of the theatre if you\u2019re not towards the center because it can compromise the viewing experience.    \nIt should also be noted that this particular film was shot digitally and there\u2019s no grain that has to be dealt with in the blow-up and so the large screen projections are exceptionally clean.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs far as Dolby goes, Atmos sound has an added benefit as we did a **Fantasound** mix.  For more information on the history of Fantasound: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasound    \nIn short, Walt Disney had developed a new sound system for Fantasia where speakers had to be set up in theaters and it was an immersive experience where the music surrounded you.  It became untenable because of the technical challenges to install the sound system in theaters and was soon abandoned. Here we tasked ourselves with updating it using today\u2019s technology to explore what Walt had set out to do.  Because of the way the Dolby Atmos theaters are speakered, what Disney at the time had to spend a lot of effort and time to do now already exists in theaters and we took advantage of that by mixing the orchestra properly and doing a proper Fantasound mix.  So if you see the film in **Dolby Atmos sound**, you are also hearing a Fantasound mix. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you prefer 2D then your standard DCP is pretty solid in most theaters, but Extended Dynamic Range definitely ups the image quality quite significantly and is well worth seeking out.  Dolby Vision is available in 2D in more locations than its 3D counterpart.    \nHere\u2019s a page that can guide you to theaters: http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-cinema/the-jungle-book.html\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you\u2019re seeing the film in 2D, I\u2019d say the seat location is not as vital as in 3D.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope this clarifies things more than it confuses. I encourage you to read the comments below and to discuss because others might have a different take on each of these formats and specific locations that might give you a better indication of what viewing experience might be best for you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt\u2019s a very exciting time to be a filmmaker as well as an audience member. There are a lot of smart people putting a lot of effort into making the theater-going experience exceptional. I look forward to these new formats being more widely available and encourage those of you who can to seek them out and see for yourself.",

Some of the lines spoken were so matter-of-fact, direct, obvious, etc. that I completely lost it several times.\n\nAs it turns out, I accidentally turned on Audio Description somehow.  I was actually pretty disappointed to find this out, because I think the movie becomes a lot funnier when it's turned on.  Either way, funny movie!\n\nTL;DR, turn Audio Descriptions on while watching Zootopia on Netflix.\n\nEdit: Wow, lots of replies and upvotes. I really do think that this was a special case of audio descriptions though because if you actually watch it, it really makes it sound like a nature documentary.

The ticket is only $35 bucks which means as long as you see at least 3 movies you're getting you're money's worth. Plus some of the films aren't even in theaters anymore, this is an easy way to see them. Super great deal imo, there's 6 or 7 I'm probably going to see.

            "body": "A trope that I find kind of annoying in many movies is their portrayal of step-dads. [This trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstFatherWins) usually finds the biological father divorced, without custody of his kids and his ex-wife has gotten remarried. By the end of the movie the step-dad is usually either revealed to be an asshole or is killed off, thus allowing the biological father to reconnect with his ex and his children.   \n\nI don't really like this trope because it really casts a bad light on step-dads. When I saw Ant-Man it started out with all of the classic elements there for the same thing to happen. Scott Lang is down on his luck and divorced from his wife. He loves his kid but there's a new fiance in the way. But by the end of the movie Bobby Canavale's character, Paxton, doesn't get totally shit on. During the movie, he does act as a sort of secondary antagonist as he is trying to arrest Scott, but we see that he is totally justified in his actions. Scott has broken the law on multiple occasions and really is not that good a father. He just got out of jail at the beginning of the movie. We see during the film that Paxton really does care for and loves his wife's daughter and he only wants what's best for her, even after he sees how much she prefers her original father over him. In the climax, Paxton does what he can to protect Cassie against Yellow Jacket. Finally in the end of the film, Scott never gets back together with his ex-wife. Instead, he and Paxton have a new respect for each other and Paxton continues to be there for his new family, while Scott goes his own way. It would have been so easy for the writers to have done the \"First Father Wins\" trope completely and I respect them for not having done so. ",

My grandpa's family was directly affected by the Armenian Genocide as his father's family was killed by the Ottoman Turks. My grandpa recently passed away, but before that he spent most of his time with my uncle putting together a family history and an extended family tree. In my own family history, there have been multiple deaths during the 1915-1920 period, most of which can be traced to the time period when \"The Promise\" takes place.\n\nAs Armenians, we have not really had movies like Schindler's List and Life is Beautiful to put the Armenian Genocide in the media forefront. I would really like to see this movie succeed. I find the behavior of the Turkish Government to be atrocious, but from my seat, the only way I can correct this type of behavior is to call it out and direct people's attention to it.\n\nReddit has been an amazing tool for achieving this so I thank all reddit users in advance for even viewing this thread. I truly hope these actions get attention, and eventually stop Turkey from trying to silence the voice and the suffering of my ancestors and our people.\n\n",

I was babysitting my cousins wearing a t-shirt of him. My cousins are 8 and 5 and could not tell me anything about him other than his name. Most children would be the same.  This is because Disney want to sell princesses and not their original stable. I feel they are missing out on billions of marketing and merchandising dollars here. \n\n&nbsp;\n \nIt then occured to me that Mickey, Donald etc all have no real origin. Maybe that is why? Because they are just an icon? They can't be turned in to a story? Or maybe they are un-relatable? \n\n&nbsp;\n \nThe most obvious argument is that Disney are too scared to touch their icon that is beloved by millions. But then why would they have revived Star Wars? - They did a great job with that so I can't see why a Mickey movie wouldn't be if it was done with love. I'd love to see this done. \n\n&nbsp;\n \nIt just seems really weird to me that Mickey Mouse has been left largely untouched for decades when his face is plastered on every single thing at Disneyland.

It has some of the best lines to take away from and reference to in real life(I'm a Dapper Dan man dammit!), and after seeing it like 20 times, its still a very funny movie, having very clever jokes that took me several viewings to get all of.\n\nAnd the music, the music is used so well, and sounds fantastic. My personal favorite is The Big Rock Candy Mountains, and everything that ensues. It's not too long and not annoying. \n\nIt also is a great adaptation of the Odyssey, and puts a modern spin on it, mixing in the great depression in with it, even going through and making the movie somewhat brownish to convey it. \n\n\nIn short, my hats off to you Coen Brothers, you made a modern classic, and my all time favorite movie.

While that sounds bad we don't really have to worry about Pixar entering Good Dinosaur territory here for several reasons. First up while that opening is lower than Cars and Cars 2, it's still within $15M of those film's openings and they both closed over $150M domestic. Cars 3 has two weekends with no children's film competition until Despicable Me 3 so it has some room to grow and with the standard excellent A rating on Cinemascore it should hold just fine like its predecessors. Also Cars is still a fairly popular franchise overseas and with Cars 2 being the only rotten rated Pixar movie and it still passing $500M worldwide, Cars 3 should end its run just fine. Finally the big thing to remember is that when it comes to the Cars franchise the box office literally doesn't matter one bit. In the decade since Cars came out the franchise has earned $10B in merchandise sales and there are still plenty of TV and theme park areas to come for the franchise. Quite frankly this movie could make negative money and still come out profitable. The real question is will this be the last Cars theatrical release, and personally I think so. Cars 3 ends with a nice way of continuing the story, but I imagine this will be the last one as the domestic wear is starting to show. Cars will now just fully embrace its identity as a brand, ironically the exact opposite angle as the story in Cars 3. \n\n* Usually I don't talk about a film that's not a new release or #1 but once again **Wonder Woman** had an incredible drop for an incredible weekend. While it didn't hold the #1 spot the film did come in at #2 with a fantastic $40.7M, a drop of just 30%. That places it as the 11th highest third weekend in history. To be clear most of the films that populate that list are films like Jurassic World, The Avengers, and The Force Awakens, aka some of the biggest openings off all time. The only other solo superhero on that list is Spiderman, and while Wonder Woman didn't top its third weekend gross it did have a lower percentage drop. Right now Wonder Woman is easily on track to pass Man of Steel's lifetime domestic gross by next week and has already passed the lifetime domestic grosses of Logan, The Amazing Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The film has also passed $500M worldwide. Oddly looking at this list the best comparison for a possible domestic lifespan of Wonder Woman is last year's The Jungle Book. Both films opened a little over $100M, both dropped around 40% second weekend and then 30% the third. If that's the case then Wonder Woman isn't just looking to pass $300M domestic, it could pass $350M and easily become the highest grossing DCEU film. If Wonder Woman manages to close at $350M that will mean it will have a opening weekend multiplier of 3.5x, a magnificent performance (for reference Man of Steel - 2.5x, BvS - 1.99x, Suicide Squad - 2.4x). Now obviously the issue is Jungle Book is an entirely different genre and usually kid's films are more spread out while superhero films tend to be front-loaded with big drops. However I think both show that good reviews and word of mouth matter a lot, especially when they don't have a massive event level opening. \n\n* Despite having very little marketing and terrible reviews the Tupac biopic still managed to leverage the rap icon's fame well as **All Eyez on Me** surprised opening at #3 with $27M. Early predictions had the film opening over $30M do to the incredible $12M Friday but the film ended up being incredibly front-loaded as by Sunday the daily number had dropped down to $6M. It's clear with this opening we aren't going to see insane Straight Outta Compton numbers but this still could potentially hold well. For one we've seen films like SOC and Get Out prove that black audiences continue to go out for black films with good word of mouth. Despite being savaged by critics, All Eyez scored an A- on Cinemascore so it could hold despite the concerns around the Friday frontloading. The film does carry a solid $40M budget and typically rap biopics don't have a great overseas life (Straight Outta Compton made 80% of its total gross in domestic sales). With predictions placing All Eyez opening below $20M this is a pretty good start and the film could potentially hold well enough to justify its costs by the end. \n\n* Sometimes movies are made just because another movie was successful, but sometimes a movie that's already been made gets a bigger release because another movie was successful. I always find those films and the results more fascinating as is the case with **47 Meters Down**, a film that was intended to go straight to VOD to cash in on the Sharknado craze but instead was released in 2,000+ theaters this weekend to bank off The Shallows' surprise hit last summer. Despite getting much worse reviews than The Shallows, it seems there is a decent shark movie audience out there as the film as the film opened at #5 to $11.5M. While not quite up to the $16M opening of The Shallows last year (in almost the exact same weekend no less) it's still a pretty great pull for a film that likely cost less than $5M to make. It's also not a bad start for production company Entertainment Studios with this being their first film. Still don't expect the audiences to stick around like they did for Shallows. While that film got a great B+ rating, 47 Meters got a rough C rating so expect it to drop hard. Still it's a solid first weekend pull especially for a film that small. Don't be surprised if next year there's a couple random summer shark movies because apparently even 40 years after Jaws summer and sharks still go together.\n\n* If you make a film with the word \"rough\" in the title it better not flop as **Rough Night** had a rough weekend opening at #7 with just $8M. The film received middling reviews from critics but even worse got a C+ rating from Cinemascore, a terrible rating for a comedy so it's very likely this film won't even pass its budget of $20M. This also represents the worst wide release opening for Scarlett Johansson since 2008's The Spirit. The fact this film couldn't even match modest predictions which had it opening in the low teens is a bad sign, especially for a film with such a notable cast. The film was the feature debut of Lucia Aniello, a Broad City alum who's mostly worked in TV. Once again like we see with The Lonely Island films success on TV rarely seems to translate to success on the big screen, especially if you employ the same kind of humor. This film is also going to put a lot more pressure on Spider-man: Homecoming as Sony has had an incredibly weak year so far. \n\n**Films Reddit Wants to Follow**\n\nThis is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren't in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on.

The lie is that it's a driver problem. That Linux just doesn't support the fake RAID mode that they forced the storage into when they deliberately sabotaged the BIOS by writing new code to hide AHCI mode and also code to reset the BIOS to their fake RAID mode if the user used EFI Shell to try setting it to AHCI. Let me make my position clear, that Lenovo is lying through their teeth just like they did with Superfish malware incident. They lied until they couldn't lie anymore. Linux should not have to support the RAID mode because the mode should be able to be changed to AHCI, which is fully compatible with Linux, by the user in about 20 seconds. \n\nIf, by some chance, some Very Smart People ever figure out a way to make the SSD visible again, I would STRONGLY advise never upgrading the laptop's firmware again, lest Microsoft and Lenovo find something else to break and then tell us \"Oops. Better run Windows 10 so you can use our 360 degree hinge! Have we told you about our 360 hinge?\".\n\nI believe that if Linux ever gains driver support for the forced fake RAID configuration, that future laptops from Lenovo will just toggle something else so Linux doesn't work on them for a while.\n\nI would strongly advise avoiding the Yoga 910 and Yoga Book when they come out until we find out whether they broke those models as well.\n\nEven if your intent is to never run Linux, Lenovo is the first PC maker I've seen that ships computers that you can't even realistically (for the average user) reinstall Windows on. I will _never_ buy another Lenovo computer again and I will advise others to avoid them whenever the chance arises. I had to spend about an hour googling random support topics before I found a recommendation to use Universal Extractor to get their Windows storage driver to use in a Windows installation thumb drive. Then I had to find a beta version of Universal Extractor that supported the archive format in the setup program just to dig the Intel RST driver out of their godawful installer so that I can slipstream it into a Windows installer.\n\nMost people will have to pay to ship it back to Lenovo if Windows needs to be reinstalled, and will be unable to use the computer for weeks, and it'll probably have some sensitive, confidential, work-related information on the SSD that someone at Lenovo could copy and steal while it's in their repair center.\n\nTheir arrogant forum moderator \"Andy_Lenovo\" posted Lenovo's ridiculous press release to their forum and then marked it as solved. The only part of it that is true is that Linux will likely never be able to install on Yoga laptops, because they are \"designed for Windows 10\", which in my experience has been unstable and full of bugs (like updates stalling out requiring manual installation from offline packages, telling me to reboot everytime I pair my bluetooth headphones, etc.). Unfortunately, in addition to Lenovo and Microsoft's lies, Matthew Garrett wrote some more horsefeathers when he blamed Linux for not supporting a storage mode that shouldn't even be in use anyway. He apparently has a long record of apologizing for Microsoft and misleading people, and it's a shame that he's in the FSF. Of course, the FSF has put some other people in high places that have proceeded to undermine their mission in the past, like Miguel de Icaza.\n\nMaybe it's true that you need \"special drivers\" to make Windows run, but Microsoft doesn't care. It breaks Linux on Lenovo laptops and then makes it look like the problem is in Linux, when it's actually in Microsoft's storage driver and Microsoft is undoubtedly leaning on Intel to keep the way the RST driver does power management a secret.\n\nTo make sure that you don't accidentally buy a Signature Edition computer, on the demo model, click the start (Windows logo) button, click \"about your PC\", and under Windows 10 it will say \"Signature Edition\" if it's part of this program. Also, if you do buy a laptop to see if Linux supports it, then make sure you try installing Linux before the return period expires. If the Linux installer in Live mode can't see your SSD, stop. Unplug the thumb drive, turn the computer off, and I would recommend that you return it. Just tell the store that you decided that you didn't need it or something. It's true.. Nobody needs this kind of aggravation.\n\nEND of my response to Lenovo and Microsoft.\n\n(You do not need to ask for my permission to repost this response in its entirety anywhere else, in hard copy, or on a website.)\n\n----\n\n\n\nI got a reply from Lenovo on my Best Buy review about why the BIOS on my Yoga 900 ISK2 UltraBook has been set to stop people from using Linux.\n\n---\nLenovo Product Expert\nSeptember 20, 2016\nThis system has a Signature Edition of Windows 10 Home installed. It is locked per our agreement with Microsoft.\n---\n\nThis is related to the discussion going on Lenovo's forum's about why the SSD is locked in a proprietary RAID mode that Linux doesn't understand. Laptops known to be affected include the Yoga 900 ISK2, Yoga 900S, and Yoga 710S, which all have the same issue according to posts I've read on Lenovo's Linux forum. I was also told in a PM that the 13ISK for Business has the same issue.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206 - The forum thread for the Yoga 900 ISK2 -UPDATE - The forum thread on Lenovo's website is back up. It was deleted for a while, but now they've re-posted it in a locked state. *sigh*\n\nHere is Google's cache of the forum in case it disappears again: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:abMCb7w2uAoJ:https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=za\n\nI'm told that CataclysmZA is backing this up in the Wayback Machine. I want to thank them for this, since this is probably Lenovo's attempt at a late night shredding party before the news can pick up the story. (Update: Posted at the bottom.\n\nUpdate: The Lenovo employee posted about locking the thread. Basically, he called me disruptive and then said that if they had to, they would turn on pre-approval so that nobody can comment anywhere on their support forum until they've read it and have made sure it won't embarrass them. Nice, huh? Don't address the issue. Don't say anything about whether the problem will be fixed. Don't re-open the thread. Just threaten and bully people with the \"We can make sure your posts are never seen.\" option.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Installing-Ubuntu-16-04-on-Yoga-900S/td-p/3336715 - The thread for the problems with the 900S.\n\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/710S-Can-t-install-Linux-on-Ideapad-710S-how-do-you-disable-RAID/td-p/3432553 - The thread for the problem with the 710S.\n\nWill the Yoga Book and the Yoga 910 have these problems? We don't know because they are not released yet, but we should know soon.\n\nI've attached a screenshot of my review for the 900 ISK2 and Lenovo's reply.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/niewu\n\nSo they admitted that this is now a requirement for Signature PCs. \n\nSo be warned that if you buy a \"Microsoft Signature PC\", it may not be allowed to run Linux, per Microsoft.\n\nThe Yoga 900 ISK2 at Best Buy is not labeled as a Signature Edition PC, but apparently it is one, and Lenovo's agreement with Microsoft includes making sure Linux can't be installed.\n\n----\n\nUPDATE: I've sent emails out to several members of the media trying to shine some light on what Lenovo is up to. If anyone could help me ping some reporters I'd sure appreciate the help. So far I've contacted Adrian Kinglsey-Hughes, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, Michael Larabel of Phoronix, and Dr. Roy Schestowitz of Techrights. We've been discussing the issue on the Techrights IRC channel on Freenode, so Techrights might have something about this posted soon\n\n----\nI just commented for someone who is writing an article who asked me to speak. Here's part of what I said...\n\n\"I think that Lenovo's official reply is insufficient and carefully worded. They talk about how much they love to support Linux and then say that they don't support Linux on many of their own laptops. Actions speak louder than words, and there's no technical reason other than the BIOS RAID mode lock why the Yoga 900 ISK2 and other affected systems wouldn't be great Linux machines. I also think that locking down the thread and editing peoples comments and then blaming forum posters for being \"disruptive\" was uncalled for, and they're obviously trying to turn this around and make it seem like I am overreacting or somehow I'm at fault for what they did. And unfortunately, some of the media reports have taken up this narrative instead of looking into why Lenovo would do such things to their computers. There is no REAL issue with Linux not supporting these laptops other than the one Lenovo created. They need to make a BIOS patch that users can install, like other Ultrabook PC makers did, not more excuses.\"\n\n\"I think that [the BIOS RAID lock] was a deliberate design choice made by Lenovo, and I say that because the BIOS code that they use has AHCI mode available for the storage device, which Linux and Windows understand without any special drivers. Lenovo patched the code to remove the AHCI mode from the BIOS setup utility and then they wrote additional code to make sure that you can't set AHCI mode with an EFI variable using EFI shell. So, I'd say it's definitely deliberate, and can't see any LEGITIMATE reason why they would have. It isn't really faster, it makes recovering Windows from Microsoft's installer very difficult if you have to later. About the only thing putting a single SSD setup into RAID mode using the BIOS gives you is (a) Linux won't be able to use the storage and (b) greater potential for data loss.\"\n\n\"I think that Microsoft and Lenovo agreed to lock Linux out, and forcing RAID mode accomplishes that. In the last 11 months, nobody except one Lenovo forum poster that used a modded BIOS and an external flasher to get around Lenovo's signature check on BIOS updates has managed to install Linux on the Yoga models affected by this. I believe that Lenovo and Microsoft figured that if Linux ever did get driver support for this configuration, that it would be years after the product was released, so it might as well be forever. Most people replace their laptop every 5 years or less, so almost nobody would ever be able to run Linux on the Yoga laptops while in their designed service life.\"\n\nEdit: If anyone has anymore problems with Lenovo deleting the thread, here's the Wayback Machine version.\n\nPage 1 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064057/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206\nPage 2 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064404/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/2\nPage 3 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064603/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/3\nPage 4 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064734/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/4\nPage 5 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064900/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/5\nPage 6 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064949/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/6\nPage 7 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065152/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/7\nPage 8 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065333/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/8\nPage 9 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065450/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/9\nPage 10 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065541/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/10\nPage 11 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065644/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/11\nPage 12 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921065754/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/12\nPage 13 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070115/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/13\nPage 14 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070321/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/14\nPage 15 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070440/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/15\nPage 16 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070608/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/16\nPage 17 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070806/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/17\nPage 18 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921070912/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/18\nPage 19 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160921071051/https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Linux-Discussion/Yoga-900-13ISK2-BIOS-update-for-setting-RAID-mode-for-missing/td-p/3339206/page/19",

I initially wanted to add an interactive console, but it became way too much work for a hobby site. \n\nI'd really appreciate any suggestions, comments, etc! :)\n\nEdit: Woah! I wasn't expecting so much awesome feedback, this is fantastic! Thank you all!\n\nEdit 2: I'm beyond ecstatic, thank you reddit for your kind words! You've given me a ton of motivation to work on this site even more!\n\nEdit 3: The site content is available for PRs on GitHub now! [Repo](https://github.com/cindyq/linuxjourney) - still pending a license. Mobile is also a lot better now. Also for those who have asked the site is made with Ruby on Rails, I pretty much just used a single book and some googling. If you want to learn Ruby on Rails, I can't recommend Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial enough :)",

This is their equivalent of the Intel Management Engine and would make AMD processors compatible with coreboot/libreboot.\n\nThis would be massive. It would make it possible to have a truly open-source machine, with all the security and privacy benefits that entails. At the moment secure boot relies primarily on aging Intel processors from nearly a decade ago.\n\nIn 2011, AMD began supporting coreboot, but stopped in 2013 and introduced the PSP. Why? Because they didn\u2019t think it was economically worthwhile.\n\n**Don\u2019t let that happen again!** Let\u2019s tell AMD there is demand for this. Get into that thread and comment. And \u2013 more importantly \u2013 message them! If you\u2019re reading this after the AMA has ended, contact them anyway!\n\n[AMD\u2019s Twitter](https://twitter.com/amd?lang=en)\n\n[AMD\u2019s Forums](https://community.amd.com/places?filterID=all~objecttype~space)\n\n[AMD\u2019s contact page](https://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/contact) (You can find details on AMD in your country) \n\nYou can also reach them on Facebook.\n\nEDIT: Some people are saying they want to call. I think that's great - do it! The best number I have found (so far) for North America is (877) 284-1566. Customer service, but they're able to take and pass on feedback at least. If anyone has other country numbers or a better one for North America, let me know and I can add them.\n\nEDIT 2: It\u2019s working! This has \u2018CEO level attention\u2019. See update post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5xvn4i/update_corebootlibreboot_on_amd_has_ceo_level/). Keep getting in touch!",

Back in the [original AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/), u/AMD_james (Product Manager in CPU Business Development) commented on this again in the last 2 hours. [Full comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/dekwva9/?context=3): \n\n\n>Thanks for the feedback. Please believe me that this has CEO level attention and AMD is investigating the steps and resources necessary to support this. It is not the work of a minute, so please bear with us as we define what we can do. \n\n\nJust to reiterate, this is **so important** for free, secure and open source computing. And enough people contacted AMD that they took notice. No actual change yet \u2013 but let\u2019s keep letting them know how much we want it, and that it could be a major boost for AMD too.\n\n\nSo, in the next few days/weeks/months - **keep contacting AMD**! Don\u2019t let them forget and don\u2019t let the FOSS and security communities forget. This is a huge opportunity and one that might not come again.\n\n\nu/AMD_james is of course right that this will take a little time. So as we wait, don\u2019t get mad that an open source PSP isn\u2019t here yet. Instead, let\u2019s just keep making it clear that we are grateful that they are looking into this and that if/when it does arrive, they will have a *lot* of dedicated customers and supporters.\n\n\nContact details below, again:\n\n\n[AMD\u2019s Twitter](https://twitter.com/amd?lang=en)\n\n[AMD\u2019s Forums](https://community.amd.com/places?filterID=all~objecttype~space)\n\n[AMD\u2019s contact page](https://www.amd.com/en-us/who-we-are/contact) (You can find details on AMD in your country) \n\nBest number for North America: (877) 284-1566\n\nYou can also reach them on Facebook.\n\nEDIT: One other possibility \u2013 contact any media outlets you think might be interested. The more people this reaches, the better our chances.",

Well, who\u2019s laughing now? It certainly isn\u2019t me.\n\nI have already decided my next laptop will be one that can run open firmware and free software. My next cell phone will be an Android running a custom rom that\u2019s been firewalled to smithereens and runs no Google (or any proprietary) software. \n\nIs this really the future of technology?

            "body": "For a few weeks I have Linux Mint 18.1 installed on my laptop. I am still in school and started a new project. With that project we use onedrive on a Office 365 platform. On my laptop I use the latest Firefox 52 browser and strictly work in Word online since document compatibilty is always an issue while working in a team.\n\nSadly enough I experienced a lot of performance issues while browsing the directory and working on a document. As I also have a desktop running Windows 10 and the same Firefox 52 browser I tried working on that and see if the problem persists. But no. The problem was no more. \n\nThen I began thinking and trying a few different things. On of the first ideas I came up with was changing the user-agent string. I changed the user-agent string to the following.\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52\n\nI the following extension in Firefox to change it.\n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/modify-headers/developers\n\nAfter changing the user-agent the performance problems were resolved. The UI of OneDrive worked flawlessly. The only thing in the user-agent changed was the OS. At first I thought this was a random occurance but no. I changed back to the normal user-agent and the problem came back. \n\nMy friend who also had this problem used the same method as I did with the same results. \n\nSo by writing this I hope to get to know if people also have this issue.\n\n**[NEW DEVELOPMENT]**\n\nSo my friend pointed out that he had no problems with Onedrive for Business anymore. I changed my own user-agent back to normal. And the problem was resolved at my end as well. \n\nIt turns out that a member of the Onedrive team spotted that there was this particular issue. Check out the first comment\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13932226",

            "body": "*(Most of what I'm going to describe applies to other file managers like Thunar, Nemo, PCManFM (GTK+ and Qt version) etc. as well, but for the sake of simplicty I'm just going to focus on GNOME Nautilus)*\n\nHere's Nautilus 3.22 with some nice looking pictures:\n\n[Screenshot 1](http://i.imgur.com/wyoliLY.png)\n\nLet's double click on one!\n\n[Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/sWXaSmq.png)\n\nDamn.\n\n\n##What exactly happened here?\n\nSomehow the following *tar.xz* archive found its way on your file system (e.g. as an email attachement): [Screenshot 3](http://i.imgur.com/UxevOQF.png)\n\n    [test@localhost Downloads]$ ll\n    total 4\n    -rw-r--r--. 1 test test 480 Jan 30 20:45 wallpaper_collection.tar.xz\n\n\n\nWith Nautilus 3.22 you can double click the file and it'll automatically extract it. Now it looks like that: [Screenshot 4](http://i.imgur.com/WDQtPUM.png)\n\n    [test@localhost Downloads]$ ll\n    total 8\n    drwxr-xr-x. 2 test test 4096 Jan 30 21:01 wallpaper_collection\n    -rw-r--r--. 1 test test  480 Jan 30 20:45 wallpaper_collection.tar.xz\n\nSo what's in *wallpaper_collection*? [Screenshot 5](http://i.imgur.com/wyoliLY.png)\n\nThose are all the nice *jpg* images we saw earlier. Now instead of double clicking on one of them, let's have a closer look. Here's what's actually on the file system:\n\n    test@localhost wallpaper_collection]$ ll\n    total 20\n    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 test test 216 Jan 30 21:01 beautiful_wallpaper.desktop\n    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 test test 237 Jan 30 21:01 Bokeh_Tails.desktop\n    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 test test 222 Jan 30 21:01 Chmiri.desktop\n    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 test test 231 Jan 30 21:01 Flowerbed.desktop\n    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 test test 222 Jan 30 21:01 Stones.desktop\n\nThose aren't *jpg* files but *desktop* files like documented [here](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html) and usually are used to describe how applications can be launched. But how come they show up as jpg files in Nautilus?\n\n\n## Examine a desktop file\n\n    [test@localhost wallpaper_collection]$ cat Bokeh_Tails.desktop\n\ngives us\n\n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Name=Bokeh_Tails.jpg\n    Exec=sh -c 'zenity --warning --text \"Congratulation!\\nGNOME Malware 3.22 successfully infected your system.\"'\n    Terminal=false\n    Icon=/usr/share/backgrounds/gnome/Bokeh_Tails.jpg\n    Type=Application\n    Categories=Graphics\n\nWell, we got lucky, all the malware did was launching a GTK+ dialog with a tool called `zenity`. But of course it could have done almost everything from fetching additional malware from the internet, encrypting all your files, adding an `alias` for sudo to get your user password, add a key logger which automatically starts when you login or just annoy you by deleting all your files. Chances are you wouldn't even notice for quite some time, because the malware could also just open an actual image so you don't get suspicious.\n\n    Exec=sh -c 'xdg-open $PATH_TO_JPG & $MALWARE_SCRIPT'\n\nBut why were those desktop files displayed as images? Well, Nautilus and other file managers think it's a good idea to hide the file name and instead show the `Name` key defined in the desktop file.\n\n    Name=Bokeh_Tails.jpg\n\nThey also show whatever icon is defined in the `Icon` key.\n\n    Icon=/usr/share/backgrounds/gnome/Bokeh_Tails.jpg\n\nAnd once you execute the desktop file, e.g. by double clicking, the value of the `Exec` key gets executed.\n\nOf course you can fake any kind of filetype this way. E.g.\n\n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Name=CV.pdf\n    Exec=sh -c 'xdg-open $PATH_TO_PDF & $MALWARE_SCRIPT'\n    Terminal=false\n    Icon=x-office-document\n    Type=Application\n    Categories=Office\n\n[Screenshot 6](http://i.imgur.com/tOnWjog.png)\n\nThe only reason I can think of why file managers do that is visual appeal, because they want to make actual application launchers look nice (with an application icon and the application name instead of the file name).\n\n## File manager comparison\n\nHow different file managers handle the following file:\n\n    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 test test 216 Jan 30 21:01 beautiful_wallpaper.desktop\n\n\nFile Manager | Hides extension | Shows `Icon` | Executes file without confirmation\n------------|---------------|------------|----------------------------------\n**Nautilus** | yes | yes | yes\n**Thunar** | yes | yes | yes\n**Caja** | yes | yes | yes\n**Nemo** | yes | yes | yes\n**PCManFM** | yes | yes | yes\n**PCManFM Qt** | yes | yes | yes\n**Dolphin** | no | yes | no\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHiding file name extensions in Windows was a bad idea and hiding file name extensions in Nautilus, Thunar, ... is even more stupid, since they should have known better because of all the trouble Windows had with that decision (many Windows users were tricked to execute files like `Nice Picture.jpg.exe`). I really wonder why this hasn't been exploited so far.\n\nMy advice: Don't use those file managers or at least don't trust them.\n\n## Edit 1:\n\nSince a couple of users wondered why they couldn't reproduce it. Note that the *desktop* files extracted from the *tar.xz* archive all have execute permission. That's important, otherwise Nautilus and other file managers ask for permission to execute the file and they display the correct filename. That's the reason why those files need to be distributed within an archive that preserves execute permissions. I will update my post later with a new section that goes into more details about that and how different file managers handle those files if they lack execute permissions.\n\n## Bugreports\n\n**Nautilus:** https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777991\n\n**PCManFM:** https://github.com/lxde/pcmanfm-qt/issues/449\n\n**Caja:** https://github.com/mate-desktop/caja/issues/727\n\n**Nemo:** https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo/issues/1404\n\n**Thunar:** I don't have an account for their [bug tracker](https://bugzilla.xfce.org/).

I've been using it since 1998, and switched to Linux as my primary OS around 2005, so I'm pretty familiar with its capabilities. \n\nToday though, I was working on my main desktop PC, an aging \"woodsman's axe\" box running an AMD FX6200 6 core, 12GB Ram, Geforce GT720 graphics card, and crucially, an Intel 128GB SSD. It was built from spare or recycled parts, and was getting a bit cranky in its old age, so I ran it with the side of the case open. \n\nTo cut a long story short, I tangled myself in a lead, knocked it over, and tipped part of a glass of water into it. I tried drying it out, but it wouldn't even post, so definitely dead. \n\nAt this stage, I started getting worried. I needed to send the work tonight, and while I'd saved it before killing the box, I didn't have another desktop computer to put the SSD into to salvage it. I did have a couple of ex-corporate laptops though, and I'd been testing Sparky Linux on an old Latitude D630, so I knew it worked (mostly) well with Linux.\n\nWithout expecting much, I took the SSD, put it into the laptop, and pressed the on button. After post, the screen went blank for quite a while, and I was about to give up, then the familiar Mint boot logo appeared, followed shortly after by my desktop. I plugged it into the USB wifi stick I'd been using on the desktop, opened the Driver Manager, checked the Broadcom internal wifi, rebooted and was back in business less than 10 minutes after I'd installed the SSD.\n\nEverything worked. I plugged in my external monitor, and finished the job.\n\nIn hindsight, I probably shouldn't have been surprised at all. Hardware detection has been extremely good for a long time, but this was just SO painless, it did shake me up a little. But in a very happy way. Thanks Linux!\n\nTLDR: I took an SSD out of a desktop, moved it into a laptop with completely different hardware and a lot less RAM. Everything worked, job got done.",

Stallman, President of the  Free  Software  Foundation\n    (FSF), on why people support the FSF and what we might be able to\n    do next. Your generosity has allowed the FSF to  push  the  fron\u2010\n    tiers  of  free  software.  Please consider making an end of year\n    [donation][0] to help us meet our fund\u2010raising goal  of  $450,000\n    by December 31st.*\n    \n    [0]: https://www.fsf.org/donate?pk_campaign=rms\u2010appeal&pk_kwd=donate\n    \n    ![http://static.fsf.org/nosvn/rms\u2010photos/20161122\u2010pam\u2010plona/20161122\u2010pamplona\u201011.jpg] \n        (Richard M. Stallman at the Euro\u2010pean Dialogues in Spain, November 2016)\n    \n    I announced the plan to develop the GNU operating system in 1983.\n    GNU  was  to be a Unix\u2010compatible operating system for timeshared\n    computers and for workstation computers. Not PCs, though, because\n    the  PCs  of  1983 were not powerful enough to run such a system.\n    Neither were laptops, of course.\n    \n    In 1992, when the kernel Linux was freed and filled the last  gap\n    in  GNU, PCs had become more powerful. It was possible to run GNU\n    on desktop PCs using Linux as the kernel. GNU/Linux in  1992  was\n    \"complete\"  in  the sense that nothing essential was missing, but\n    it was rudimentary in that many  much\u2010used  proprietary  applica\u2010\n    tions had no free counterparts.\n    \n    Nowadays  many of those applications have been replaced, but some\n    are missing. Meanwhile, new theaters of computing  have  come  to\n    exist, and the work of liberating them remains ahead of us.\n    \n    All commercial mobile phones require proprietary software (in the\n    modem processor that talks to the phone radio network) that has a\n    universal  back  door: it can be changed remotely through the ra\u2010\n    dio.  It should be a felony to make such a product, but it isn\u2019t.\n    \n    With funds, the FSF could launch a campaign to make that practice\n    a  felony.  With funds, the FSF could develop a mobile phone that\n    encapsulates the modem processor so as to make the  phone,  in  a\n    limited sense, safe to use.\n    \n    On the other end of computing, many Web sites\u2019 pages contain non\u2010\n    free software (sent in the form of JavaScript  code)  which  they\n    install  and  run  in the user\u2019s browser. In many cases that code\n    spies on the user.\n    \n    With funds, the FSF could develop free software front ends to en\u2010\n    able  Internet  users  to  talk to various important Web services\n    without running any nonfree software to do it.\n    \n    Meanwhile, freedom is threatened even at the level of the proces\u2010\n    sors  in  PCs.  The current generation of Intel and AMD processor\n    chips are designed with vicious back doors that users cannot shut\n    off. (In Intel processors, it\u2019s the \"management engine\".)\n    \n    No users should trust those processors.\n    \n    With funds, the FSF could campaign to pressure those companies to\n    give us a way to shut those back doors off.\n    \n    We also need to enforce the GNU General Public License (GNU  GPL)\n    against  companies  that regard its requirement to respect users\u2019\n    freedom as a nuisance. This too requires funds.\n    \n    Why do people support the FSF? Because they appreciate the impor\u2010\n    tance  of  the freedom that we defend, for them and for everyone.\n    However, since 1998 we have had to make  an  explicit  effort  to\n    spread  awareness of this issue. In that year, a corporate\u2010funded\n    campaign to disconnect free software from our ideas began to  re\u2010\n    brand  free software as \"open source\" so as to disconnect it from\n    our ideas of right and wrong. People  who  don\u2019t  understand  how\n    proprietary  software  denies them freedom may not see what there\n    is to fight for.\n    \n    The FSF campaigns team spreads awareness  of  computing  freedom.\n    With  more  funds,  we  could hire additional staff to do more of\n    this.\n    \n    Please continue to support the FSF with a donation today.\n    \n    *[Donate][0] and [share this appeal][1] with your friends.*\n    \n    [1]: https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/a-message-from-rms-support-the-free-software-foundation\n    \n    Happy Hacking,  \n    Richard M.

Remember: All they did was get a new CEO, the company culture is still there.\n\nAll that's changed is instead of publicly hating on Linux, they now publicly love Linux, but are really still very hostile to Linux. This will never change.\n\nJust remember the Iowa consumer case files ( http://edge-op.org/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/ ) which has a lot of internal emails from Microsoft, many of them basically state their love for all things Windows and MS and hatrid for everything else. All are in PDF format and have been unsealed (thankfully). Some even go into detail about their plotting with things like the Vista Ready program in order to trick consumers (they basically don't give a shit) etc.\n\nThen there's Halloween docs:\nhttp://www.catb.org/esr/halloween/\n\nAgain, take your pick - Get The FUD, whatever you choose. It's all there. Then there's Ballmer's \"Linux is cancer\" etc.\n\nYeah, yeah sure, I'm off my rocker, this was all years ago etc. But it's not - Microsoft HATES Linux, this will NEVER change! Again, the only thing that has change is the CEO and as a result, the PR. You'll probably find that Nadella has internally said to everyone \"publicly, we LOVE Linux and FLOSS, internally it's still business as usual\"; and changed the PR machine as a result.\n\nNow I don't know what Shuttleworth and Canonical are playing at or what benefit they may get from the deal they made, perhaps more Ubuntu market share (and money). But don't let your guard down - Microsoft will ALWAYS hate Linux, even if you can't directly see it.\n\nDo you really think Bill Gates, while no longer chairman or CEO (he still works there tho), would *really* let his company, his ways, his wants and direction etc all go down the toilet and have someone else come in and take it all in a new direction? No... Gates is very smart and ruthless. MUCH smarter than that. His / the \"old Microsoft\" dirty business ways are fully entrenched in the company. No single change of CEO will fix the ways of the \"old Microsoft\".\n\nThe \"old Microsoft\" is still the \"new Microsoft\", only the face of the company has changed - CEO and PR. That's it. Microsoft, if they could, would press a button and kill Linux and FLOSS over night.\n\nRemember the \"patents\" they have that they will use to threaten our ways, even if not directly. Microsoft will always be hostile to Linux and free software. Remember that!\n\n**EDIT**: Wow, so many replies! And GOLD, thank you, kind sir / mam. Yes, the links are old, but so what - who is funding SCO (MS probably), the Android extortion etc etc etc, it all still goes on...",

As a result our current intention is to only support Vulkan and eventually drop support for DX11 as this shouldn't effect any of our backers. DX12 would only be considered if we found it gave us a specific and substantial advantage over Vulkan.

Lunduke things it will be right away.\n* There is a 2 week appeal period. Doubtful that anything will come of that.\n* Closed Source Software was a mistake\n* Breaking DRM is a crime in the US, no exception is made for this DRM.\n* DRM could potentially restrict based on OS, location, or a host of other arbitrary things.\n\nFrom the Verge article:\n\n>There are also accessibility and competitive concerns. There are no exemptions here that would allow computers to scan videos and automate work like generating subtitles and translations or identifying strobing lights to produce warnings for people with epilepsy. EME doesn't standardize decryption either, and Doctorow writes that companies developing browsers may have to license decryption components, making it harder for new browsers to enter the market.\n",

Unlike the Mac port that just quite literally worked out of the box, the Linux one had a few problems and just getting Linux itself to behave is a challenge of its own. The biggest problem faced is that you don't know if a specific issue is your code, the game engine code, driver code or the distro that you're running.\n\nI was testing with no AA because my Intel GPU driver does not support AA. Thankfully I had a friend that could help me out by testing it on an nvidia GPU where AA worked just fine. \n\nHaving said all of that, the port itself took only two weeks. In game development terms, that\u2019s not a long time at all and as this becomes an easier process every day we may soon see more AAA companies bringing their games over even on launch. \n\nHere's to hoping that this is just another small step in the direction of getting Linux to be a serious competitor in the gaming industry. I know my game alone is not going to do that, but maybe if enough of us devs take the leap first it will make it easier for the regular users to take the leap as well.\n\nNext stop: Vulkan and SteamVR! When Unity3D supports it that is\u2026\n\nAlso feel free to AMA, I'm really happy to reply to any questions that I can. \n\nEDIT: [Here is a review made by gamingonlinux.com, should you want to know more about how the game behaves](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/void-21-a-nicely-presented-procedurally-generated-arcade-style-fast-paced-runner-and-shooter-now-on-linux.7164)",

And the argument is that its better for the community if people contribute to the same technologies. Makes sense.\n\nWell, a web browser is also a very big project and the situation of the open web is just as worse freedom wise with Google via Chrome controlling the web for the most part. As things stand right now, Firefox is the only mainstream browser that is open source and cares for the open web.\n\nMozilla has been in the web market for a long time and they actually invest a lot of effort to make the web a better place. But still it has been difficult because the competition has way more resources and market share.\n\nGiven this scenario, what sense does it make to build yet another browser instead of making Firefox better? It would give Firefox a standing chance against the bigger players.\n\nIn fact, one can argue, the benefits of working together on Firefox and making it better is spread multi-platform and is more important than many Linux desktop only technologies. \n\nSo why does GNOME get a pass for causing fragmentation in an important market and not helping the mainstream browser instead?",

            "body": "Like many, I've always received excellent customer support from Newegg, but apparently they aren't big fans of Linux.  I ordered an E525 Thinkpad from them that I received on time and seemingly without issue.  The system appeared to work properly and had no issues with the Linux Mint 13 install placed on it for 2 days.  On the third day of use a loud coil squeal/chirp became apparent, becoming louder when it was running on battery power.  Within hours the wireless chipset failed and refused to connect, the display began glitching with horizontal lines appearing through it, and it became unresponsive.  I tested it with a Windows live USB thumb drive, just to ensure there was no problem with the OS before RMAing it. \n\nThe RMA was declined for a \"modified/altered operating system.\"  I spoke with a support agent, as well as a manager who couldn't comprehend the difference between an obvious hardware failure that could be found running the BIOS provided diagnostics, and the Linux installation.  \n\nI've used Newegg for years and spent tens of thousands on tech gear with them, so I'm really bummed out by this situation.  I know that they've gone through quite a bit of growth lately and I had hoped that they would retain their world class customer service.  It appears that they haven't.  :(\n\nEDIT 1 - I'll get a copy of the RMA reply I had today, just give me a sec.  The \"manager\" I talked to wouldn't respond to any attempt to explain the situation at all.  She said that the system had been modified and was very forceful in standing by the refusal.  \n\nEDIT 2 - RMA decline response -> http://imgur.com/7bcIJ  \nThe restore partition was left intact, so I don't know what issue they're having there.\n\nEDIT 3 - Yes, I intentionally left the name on the RMA response.  Hoping perhaps I might get a call from Newegg.\n\nEDIT 4 - I submitted this to Consumerist earlier today and am waiting to hear back from them.\n\nEDIT 5 - I'm going to sleep now and will check this in the morning.  Not sure of whether I will hear back from them on the weekend, but Newegg has been informed of this post by myself and others.\n\n6/9/2012\n\nEDIT 6 - WOW! I just woke up and was not expecting the level of response I've gotten from this post.  Still nothing from Newegg, but I certainly wouldn't expect it at 3:37am PDT.  I'll keep everyone updated on what I hear back.\n\nEDIT 7 - I still haven't heard anything from them at 12:04pm EST, and I'm not sure if I will before Monday.\n\n6/10/2012\n\nEDIT 8 - This edit will remain with a periodically updated time until I hear back from them.  NO RESPONSE AS OF - 11:42PM EST Jun 10\n\n6/11/2012\n\nEDIT 9 - I'm receiving some scripted looking emails from info@newegg.com this afternoon:\n\n\"This notification has been sent because we provided you an earlier email in error. You were sent an email indicating that we had posted your item(s) as part of the \"Return.\" Unfortunately, this was sent in error; although it is rare, RMA numbers are occasionally posted by mistake.\"\n\nDon't know what to make of that considering I was escalated and spoke with a manager who had my account pulled up and the exact response from the tech about the \"modified OS.\"\n\nI also got a blank $0.00 order confirmation from them and a UPS 3 Day Select shipping confirmation.  Don't know if that's the old one coming back or if they're sending a new one.    The order number comes up blank if I check the status on Newegg.com.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n6/12/2012\n\nEDIT 10 (hopefully final) -\n\n I'm sure many of you saw this story on Consumerist and the front page of Slashdot today.  I spoke with a \"Public Image Professional\" from Newegg who contacted me via email.  She immediately offered to replace the laptop or process a full refund, and I accepted the latter given all the issues I've had with them.  I received an RMA confirmation telling me that it has been approved as a defective product return, and that I will receive a credit in 3-5 business days.\n\nSo pending a credit, they've resolved the issue.",

What is this I don't even... *You guys rock!* Thanks to all of you who have stepped up and made your voice heard.\n\n*None of the items below will automatically make you a criminal in all situations*; It will affect individuals differently depending on their circumstances. The bill is also not centered around Linux, but it has a very strong impact on Linux as we know it.\n\n**Yes**, there *are* alternative players for Linux which are properly licensed, but this bill gives copyright holders the ability to define what a 'properly licensed' player is via the terms of their DRM. What happens when they decide that iTunes is the only licensed media player for DVDs and Blu-Ray?\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis is a kind of crosspost summary of a new copyright amendment bill that was announced yesterday. [Bill C-32](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&Mode=1&Language=F&File=72#16) attempts to 'modernize' copyright law in Canada to bring it up to spec with other developed nations (aka to meet US agenda).\n\nThe bill would make it illegal to circumvent or break locks of any kind on digital media, even for personal use. This supersedes all other provisions of the bill, which means you may be a criminal if you\n\n*   Own and play region-locked DVDs from other countries\n*   Play regular DVDs on Linux\n*   Play Blu-Ray *Discs* on Linux\n*   Transfer media to an iPod Touch / iPhone / iPad using Linux\n*   Strip DRM from music on Linux in order to listen to it\n\nAnd anything else that involves restricted content that lacks official Linux support.\n\nSpeak up while you can. [Find your MP](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/HouseOfCommons/MemberByPostalCode.aspx?Menu=HOC&Language=E) and write them an email telling them why you are opposed to [C-32](http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&Mode=1&Language=F&File=72#16). \n\nWe don't want a US style DMCA, please don't let that happen.\n\n**Edit:** Here is a template based on the email I wrote to *my* MP. Feel free to use it, modify it, or ignore it. :)\n\n**Also:** If you are willing, please take the time to handwrite a letter to your MP instead of sending an email. It's guaranteed to make a much much stronger impact and is a lot harder to ignore. However, don't let this discourage you from sending your email instead. Every voice counts!\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nDear **<Your MP>**,\n\nI am writing to you again to express a major point of concern I have found with the newly tabled Bill C-32. While this bill appears to make many positive changes, there is one clause which is particularly troubling.\n\n\nIn Article 41 it becomes clear to me that any media with Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection applied supersedes all other changes introduced by the bill. For example, **<Something that affects you personally, such as not being able to legally watch DVDs on Linux>**\n\n\nThis bill does not help the consumer, and it does not help the copyright owner either. If it does not help either of these parties, who is benefiting from it?\n\n\nBill C-32 has potential, but it needs work.\n\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n\n-**<Your Name>**\n\n\nArticle 41: http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&Mode=1&Language=F&File=72#16\n\n------------------------------\n------------------------------------",

            "body": "I'm a k12sysadmin supporting 3 districts and ~8 schools. Almost all of them have huge investments in aging workstations running XP/Deep Freeze. Many have fallen into disuse, slower than molasses or outright not booting. The machines are physically fine, and actually pretty powerful (Core2 w/ 2GB RAM), but they aren't licensed for Win7/8 and the deployment costs alone are prohibitive for any sort of software upgrade.\n\nA little over a year ago, I started tinkering with LTSP. I knew we didn't need a full-blown VDI environment, since mostly kids just need to get online for research, etc. I thought, \"if we could just PXE boot to Chrome, that would be enough.\"\n\nWell, after a year of development and red tape, here we are. We're in a phase 2 beta test across 4 schools and over 100 workstations, and so far it's been a smashing success. Teachers, students and administrators are literally stunned in disbelief at how simple, fast and useful these things can be.\n\nWired clients PXE boot to a full-screen Chrome browser, complete with managed bookmarks, SafeSearch, and other goodies baked right in. Since the new web-based state testing program releases a Linux client, I can swap clients to that (and back to Chrome) in about 30 seconds.\n\nEverything runs locally in RAM, so they are actually faster than even modern workstations. Nothing is stored or installed locally, and updates are easily rolled out from the server. Since all processes run client-side, the server basically just serves tftp and nbd with *very* modest resources. I'm even running one server on a Dell OptiPlex with no issues. I only had to touch workstations once, to change boot order to PXE. If they need/want Windows, it's just a matter of changing boot order back. For those interested, I put together a [how-to guide](http://ternarybit.org/chrome-web-kiosk-guide/).\n\nSo, because of Linux, literally tens of thousands of dollars in equipment that was ready for recycling is now more useful than ever. They don't miss Windows because basically everything is now a webapp/webgui. Those who truly need Windows are a vanishing minority, which feels really, really good to type.\n\n",

Two years ago, my parents bought me a rather nice computer and paid for a good firewall and Microsoft Office Suite. I almost immediately installed Ubuntu. I have had it on there for 2 years, with no problems. Yesterday, my step-father used my computer and I was forced to explain. They are now furious at me. I feel like a lot of it is their own misconceptions about Linux and how it works. They have expressed that they are confident my computer is now infected with viruses because I am not using the firewall they paid for. They are also worried that hackers will use my computer to get to communicate with their desktop and steal their banking information. They also want me to pay back the full price of my laptop, because I \"pissed all over an expensive gift.\" This is all despite the fact that my computer continues to operate perfectly. I have tried arguing my case, but they keep asserting, correctly, that I am not an expert in all things Operating System and so they will not listen to me. \n\nAny advice you can provide would be really appreciated. I don't really know what to do.\n\nUpdate: I spoke with my mother today. She had all day to calm down and do some research, so the discussion was much easier. I gave her a lot of the information and articles that all of you provided. She still has some concerns, but seemed much more willing to accept that Linux is all right. I showed her the output of netstat -tuap and explained what each of the connections was. I'm not sure if she fully understood (Those numbers do look scary to anyone who doesn't do stuff like this on a regular basis), but it did seem to calm her down. I also read a lot of the responses from this forum to her (Thank you so much to all of the people who sent back responses).\n\nWe eventually came to a pretty good compromise. She has allowed me to keep Ubuntu on my computer, as long as I dual-boot with Windows. She wants me to scan both for viruses weekly and only use Windows while behind their firewall, but I am allowed to use Linux at school. My step-father wants me to pay back the price of the firewall/anti-virus subscription that I did not use ($120). I think I will do yard work for my neighbors for the next two months until I can get that back. \n\nSo, all things considered, I think that went pretty well. Thank you so much for all of your advice, resources, and support. When I posted this, I really only expected a single-digit number of responses. This community was wonderful and so incredibly supportive. It really makes me proud to call myself a Linux user. ",

            "body": "tl;dr: I've tested almost 100 DRM free Linux games from the Humble bundles and store. My goal was to see if normal, non-geek PC users will be able to play them.\n\nYour miles may vary! But this is my experience. I've used a Clevo W840 SU laptop with Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 and 16.04, with the Gnome Staging PPA.\n\nHumble has a [DRM-Freedom sale](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/promo/drmfreedom/) right now, so I'm publishing [my test results](https://docs.zoho.com/sheet/published.do?rid=nc4und89223056a4745c0adeb0002b7fb3325), even though I still have more games I'm going to test.\n\n* * *\n\nThis text, with the spreadsheet embeded and a bit more details on why free software and DRM-free software is much more important than you'd think, [is available on my blog]( http://blogg.forteller.net/2016/humble-test/). (There's no ads, and I don't profit from this in any way)\n\n* * *\n\nI love [Humble](https://www.humblebundle.com/)! Especially how it started out, with the Indie bundles. They combine most of my favorite things: Small, independent companies, Linux, DRM-free media and amazing charities! I tried to buy all of the first Indie bundles. Unfortunately I missed some of them, but I still spent $290 on buying seven of the first ten Indie bundles. It was a matter of pride to help the Linux average stay as far above the others as possible.\n\n\nLater there came other bundles, and I admit I was disappointed when not all of them where indie, supported Linux or where DRM free. But still, Humble has done an amazing job in getting a ton of games ported to Linux while contributing millions of dollars to charities, and I wanted to support that. So whenever I saw a bundle where all (or sometimes most) the games where supported DRM-free on Linux I would buy it.\n\nBut I soon started noticing a big problem. Quite a few of the games I bought didn't seem to actually work! Or I had to jump trough some crazy hoops that no self respecting developers would ever think to ask any Windows or Mac OS users to jump trough.\n\nI understand that there is a smaller market of Linux users and I understand that it's not that simple for someone who has been developing for one platform to turn around and develop for another. But I have bought these games because they where advertised as working on Linux, without DRM. And you just can not sell a product you don't have!\n\nSo I started testing my games systematically, and [my temporary result is what you see in this spreadsheet](https://docs.zoho.com/sheet/published.do?rid=nc4und89223056a4745c0adeb0002b7fb3325). I wanted to publish my results while the Humble Store still has their [DRM-Freedom sale, which lasts for the next two days](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/promo/drmfreedom/), and so I plan on updating the spreadsheet with more games as I get around to them. (Want to help out? Look at the bottom of this post)\n\nI want to make very clear that this is not meant to be The Answer with two lines under! Your miles may very! I am not a very technical person, and so I might have done some things wrong.\n\n**But that is also the point.** I'm not a techno geek e-l33t-ist hacker, and it is of crucial importance that no one feels the need to be one to use Linux or other Free and DRM-free software! As [Cory Doctorow says](http://corydoctorow.wikia.com/wiki/Sense_About_Science_lecture):\n\n> We have computers on our desks, and we have computers in our pocket. We have computers we insert into our bodies, and we have computers into which we insert our bodies. And they have the power to liberate us or to enslave us. When computers don't tell us what they're doing they expose us to horrible, horrible risks.\n\nThe only way we can control our own future is trough [Free/Open source software](https://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html) and DRM-free software. And [Linux on the desktop is one important, and simple way](http://computefreely.org/), of starting to go down that path.\n\nThat is, most things about Linux is simple, but some things are not: It would be much simpler if those who advertised their products as working on Linux actually made sure that they did. And that is why I took the time to test almost a hundred DRM free Linux games.\n\nThe more people use Linux, the more companies will invest in making sure their products work as well on Linux, and the more products that works flawlessly on Linux, the more people will use Linux.\n\nIt's a chicken/egg problem, or it's a virtuous cycle. That is up to us to decide.\n\nMy hope is that this list, with waaay too much red in it, will:\n\n*   Make it easier for you to support game companies that takes their Linux users seriously\n*   Help you avoid buying games you can't play anyway\n*   Make Humble work harder to get companies to support Linux properly\n*   Perhaps shame some game companies into updating their Linux versions\n\nIf you find these to be worthy goals, then **please help me spread this information far and wide!** That way we can both make a small contribution to a better world.\n\nNow, onto what you're here for: First, just a few words about my setup: My laptop is a Clevo W840 SU with an Intel Core i7-4500U CPU @ 1.80GHz \u00d7 4, Intel Haswell Mobile graphics card, 16 GB RAM and a 256 GB SSD.\n\nMy OS is Ubuntu Gnome, and I've tested some games on version 15.10 and some on 16.04\\. On both versions I updated to newer, but more unstable versions of Gnome with the help of the Gnome Staging PPA.\n\nAll of that said, [here are my results](https://docs.zoho.com/sheet/published.do?rid=nc4und89223056a4745c0adeb0002b7fb3325).\n\n**There are also some other annoyances** not mentioned in the spreadsheet, like how some games comes with a to of download links or files which might be the correct one to double click to run the game. If you're just a little bit less of a geek than I am then you won't know which file to download or click on. Also: What's the deal with compressing the game in a folder just called \"Linux\"? Don't you think it would be a good idea to at least let people know what game hides in that folder after it's uncompressed?\n\nIf you want to help me test more games please let me know! You could either test some yourself and add them to the list, or you could buy me some games from [my Humble wishlist](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/wishlist/20457509) Send e-mail and/or games to mail@forteller.net.\n\nThank you!

            "body": "I am the technology integration coordinator at a Title 1 school in DC (students are very poor, many live in pretty bad poverty).  About a month and a half ago I read a reddit post entitled something like \"How to get into linux.\"  It was a \"best of\" post that made it to the front page.  I followed the guide, installing virtualbox on my Windows machine to try out linux.  Soon I found myself testing Lubuntu on some of my school's older computers (computers from about 2003, many had 512 mb of ram).  These computers, with Lubuntu installed, now run faster than the new netbooks the school has purchased that are running Windows 7 with 2GB of ram for 500 bucks a piece.  Right now I'm working on a universal Lubuntu image for the school computers, and am playing around with mass imaging using Clonezilla (something the district doesn't even do, their technicians walk around with USB sticks).  I've found that I can get TONS of free computers for my school that are a bit older, but run faster than our newer computers that are running windows, so long as Lubuntu is installed.  So far I am up to 30 free computers in my school.  The kids don't know the difference, and neither do the teachers (many of our teachers are not very tech-savvy).  I just wanted to thank the reddit linux community for introducing me to linux, and sparking my new obsession with learning as much as I can about it to make my school as tech-rich as possible.\n\nTLDR:  Reddit introduced me to linux, now I use it on older computers in my Title 1 school to make free computers useful, kids living in poverty benefit.\n\nUPDATE:  I've gotten MS Word and MS Excel working via PlayOnLinux.  I'm giving DC public schools less and less to complain about should they catch me....\n\nEDIT:  Someone found the post that inspired me to finally get off my bum and learn linux! http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/lcj6g/iwtl_linux/c2rla1h\n\nEDIT:  Thank all of you so much for all of this information.

I've had girls jokingly ask to \"Netflix and chill\" but when I tell her that I don't use Netflix since Netflix requires proprietary software to stream content, they stop talking to me. And worse if they do stay they think I'm weird since I blocked google IP's in my host file and we can't even watch youtube. I can't ever seem to get girls to come over to my place and I can't text them either. Once I get their numbers since I've added customs roms to my phone and refuse to use sms since it's a security concern I require all of my friends to download a free and open source messaging app and I share with them my public gpg key so that we can verify that our conversations are secure. None of my friends are willing to do this. And I can't use sites like tinder since it's not only proprietary software but a major privacy vulnerability. How come it is so hard to find a girl concerned about software freedom. I feel like I'm going to be a virgin forever.\n\nEDIT: Btw the this post is GPLv3. So feel free to use it however you want but please send you changes back to me.",

That was the only one about Linux at the time. The problem was that at some point this magazine was not sold in my state anymore so I could not get new distros. Internet was not an option, it was impossible to download a full distro and buying the magazine online was not a reality yet . So I realised I could send an email to this magazine saying that I bought it and the CD was not working and they would send me \"another CD\" right away even in my location where it was not sold. At the time I realised it was not very ethical (I was young)  but now I look back and realize I was a powerful hacker doing social engineering.",

Want to install 6 packages at once? GOFERIT. Want to completely change the UX/UI? DONE. \n\n\nBut now, 6 months later, its totally normal, even maybe a bit boring. Its just a way for me to get work done, just like Windows or OSX or Android. A portal to the internet. When I first started Linux, all my non-technology friends would shudder and their eyes would glaze over when I even mentioned Linux. They all thought that it was only for television hackers and scientists.... If they even knew what it was. And as a person with a non-tech job, I thought that it would be a fun challenge. Its not challenging or difficult, its just like Windows and OSX. (Granted, I am not doing Linux Wizardry on a daily basis for a job.)\n\nI can't believe how normal and second nature it has become, and now when I am forced to use Windows, I find the whole ordeal distasteful. After using Ubuntu, and getting used to that, I can definitely feel Microsoft breathing down my throat a bit when I use Windows. Worse then that, my computer is this 12 year old Lenovo disaster where the case is literally falling apart, so I can hardly even turn on Windows anymore because it takes 20 minutes to boot with all the updates.\n\nI think us normal people can get behind Linux once were properly introduced to it, but I can definitely see why its tough to get people  to step out of their comfort level.\n\nYou can lead a horse to water, and all that jazz.",

And this was sometimes happening on a fresh installation.\n\nGnome-shell memory leaks.\n\nLaggy animations\n\nIf for some reason (e.g. upgrade) display manager switched from GDM to LightDM or vice versa, login was not accepting my password.\n\nAfter several hours of usage, system needed a restart or otherwise it was becoming unusable.\n\nConstant disk read-write operations while idle.\n\nThere are so much more, I can't recall all of the problems. These were happening on both the slow and powerful machines.\n\nBut all of them were solved since I switched my desktop environment to XFCE (Xubuntu).\n\nI've been using it for around 1 month and my system has never been so stable. I'm using the same Ubuntu version, same libs and tools, doing the same things.\n\nAfter just several hours of installing XFCE, I fell in love with the panel, its plugins, stability of the plugins and simplicity of customization.\n\nNo memory leaks, no freezing, no slowing down, absolutely nothing.

            "body": "So older macbooks are going for less than a hundred bucks on ebay right now. It's not because their hardware is obselete or they don't work, it's because apple stops supporting their hardware at the OS level after a few years so you buy their newest models. Anyway, I don't have any love for their OS, and I think to myself, how hard can it be to throw another one on there to breath some new life into these expensive unibody paperweights?\n\nBoy do I regret answering that question for myself\n\nTrouble is, Apple doesn't want you to put another OS on their hardware, because they lose control over when it becomes obselete. If you have linux, or windows, or whatever on there, their \u201cunsupported\u201d aluminum bricks keep on chugging. And with a ton cheap replacement parts from all the other artificially obseleted hardware. \n\nSo, being that installing your choice of OS on their machines is a problem for apple, they make it as inconvenient as possible to do it. I'm here to tell you that it IS possible though, and being that I love creating unnecessary work for myself, I'm gonna go through the ass-backwards process for multiple operating systems to prove that you can.\n\nIronically, apple has created a bunch of cheap, well built computers that will last a long ass time in their attempts to sell expensive computers that have a shelf life similar to the items in the produce section of whole foods. It's a brainfuck to get them working though.\n\nNo matter what OS you want to use, there's some things (arguably too many) things you're gonna need on this simple, easy, million step, ass reaming of a journey. It's easy to fuck up, but Don't get discouraged though, stops hurting after the first few tries.\n\nYou'll obviously need a disc image of your preferred OS, and a Mac OS X install DVD. Also, 3 mass storage devices, one for your OS install media, one to put your ~~pirated~~ original Mac OS X image on, and one to do a fresh install of OS X onto. The one for the OSX installer needs to be 16GB, and That last one will need to be 32GB minimum, on account of all the built in Apple bloat. I used a hard drive from the hardware graveyard in an external enclosure, but a USB drive works just as easily. \n\nNow, you could use DVDs for this, but I mean, come on, it's 2016, we're not fucking cavemen, so get out a few of the dozens of USB flash drives you've accumulated over the years so you can make this process a lot easier for yourself. \n\nBurn your installation media using your preferred OS and totally legit copy of OS X, taking care to make sure it's the outdated version it came with, and get ready to truly understand the meaning of tedium. \n\nAfter properly bracing yourself for the imminent existential crisis this experience will bring about, pop in your OS X USB, and the larger, empty USB. Hold either alt, or C during bootup depending on which model of macbook you're working with. This will let you boot from the install USB. Once youre into the installation menu, click utilities > disk utility in the top toolbar, and format the big external drive to HFS+ (or mac OSX extended/journaled, depending on installer version.) Then erase the internal hard drive, and partition it to have one 200 MB HFS+ partition at the beginning of the drive labelled EFI for later, and an exFAT partition taking up the rest of the drive's space, making sure that you're using the GUID partition table and not MBR. From here, install OS X onto your USB, leaving the internal HDD as is.\n\nNow, you won't be using these OS X drives after this ever again, unless you manage to fuck your main OS up so badly you need to start over. But you need them, nonetheless. Boot into the fresh OSX install, and update to the latest version your mac supports, skipping the itunes and other non-core application updates if time is a concern. This is to make sure the laptop has the latest firmware, because again, apple wants to make life for their customers as difficult as possible if they choose to think differently about how they want to use apple hardware, after the updates finish, download the refind binary image, and extract it.\n\nCreate a folder on that partition you made earlier on the internal HDD, called efi, and make a folder inside that called refind. The directory structure of the mounted volume should look like \n\n    /Volumes/EFI/efi/refind\n\nthen copy everything from the refind folder from the .zip you extracted into the folder on the partition, then delete the .efi files that don't match your mac's architecture. (if it's a core 2 or later, keep amd64, if its a regular core duo, keep ia32. Always delete aa64.) \n\n    Finally, rename refind.conf-sample to refind.conf\n\nThis file controls variables like default boot option and boot time delay. You can edit it to speed up boot time, customize the loader's looks, etc.\n\nNot only has apple made it impossible to boot if there's not a HFS+ volume present on the machine, they've also introduced a delay if the machine doesn't detect that OSX is installed, too. You can get around this delay by \u201cblessing\u201d the partition using this command in terminal:\n\n    sudo bless --setBoot \u2013folder /Volumes/EFI/efi/refind \u2013file /Volumes/EFI/efi/refind/refind_YOUR-ARCH.efi\n\nShut down the laptop, remove the system USB, and reboot. You should see the refind bootloader after a short delay. Cut the laptop back off. From here, you're primed to install something functional. The key is to install them in legacy mode, and write the bootloader to he partition, not the device. Refind recognizes and chainloads whaever you put on there \n\nI used OpenBSD and Archlinux to test this, and they both work. and I've heard anecdotally that ubuntu and windows 7 work about as well with a few of their own quirks. As long as you don't touch the refind partition, you're golden. Refind also recognizes install media, so you can boot the installer from there as well.\n\nFor OpenBSD, install like normal, but when it asks where, hit (E)dit, and change the exfat partiton's type to A6 (OpenBSD).  For those not familiar with OpenBSD, this can be done with the following comands when the installer drops you into fdisk:\n\n    >edit 1\n    >A6\n    >write\n    >exit\n\nproceed as normal from here. Refind will recognize it as a windows installation or generic \u201clegacy OS.\u201d I like it on the near decade old macbook I purchased because it's secure, stable, it idles at less than 50MB ram and does everything I need the laptop to do.\n\nThe webcam may not work, and neither will the media keys. You may also need some additional configuration depending on the gpu, wireless card, etc. My model worked out of the box with the exception of the webcam and touchpad gestures/multitouch, though.\n\nI had slightly more success with archlinux, though the \u201cisight\u201d webcam still refuses to work, as apple somehow managed to get custom firmware onto a pretty universally generic component  in the name of planned obsolescence.\n\nArchlinux is a different animal, and requires a little more finesse to install.\n\nSet it up normally, using GPT partitioning tools, taking care to define a /boot partition and install your bootloader/.efi there instead of writing to the drive. \n\nIf you use GRUB to manage the efi boot, remove [quiet] from the config file generated by grub-mkconfig, and take care to make the correct grub .efi for your architecture (32bit on older intel systems.) Any linux system you try to install using grub will fail to boot if these steps aren't taken. \n\nThe media keys, mouse multitouch and everything else works great sans webcam after the obligatory configurations. \n\nSo,  if you got all the way to the end of this, you made it. you have a fully functional, modern OS without dual booting or 30+GB of bloat on your hard drive. If you want a capable laptop for less than $200, with good build quality and scads of replacement components, then thinkpads are not your only option.\n\n**EDIT:** *I realize that this is not strictly necessary if you have a new machine and just want to throw a 'buntu or RHEL-based distro onto it. This guide is for older hardware that no longer supports the latest and greatest versions of OS X, or runs them like shit. It also attempts to cover the less cooperative models in the Apple lineup, including those with 32-bit and hybrid EFIs. Which tend to be the very cheap ones in the resale market. You may not need this guide if your favored OS works with a regular install, but there's more than a small chance that it won't and if it doesn't this resource is for you.* \n\n**If you have a new MBP, just throw linux on it and get on with your day. This resource was not written for you, and you're misleading those that could benefit from it by implying you can install an alternate OS without trouble in all cases.**",

We're helping the Ubuntu GNOME team, not creating something different or competitive with that effort. While I am passionate about the design ideas in Unity, and hope GNOME may be more open to them now, I think we should respect the GNOME design leadership by delivering GNOME the way GNOME wants it delivered.\n\n>Our role in that, as usual, will be to make sure that upgrades, integration, security, performance and the full experience are fantastic.\n\nShit, doesn't look like it will be customized enough to be Unity-like: :/\nThough there's still time to 18.04 so maybe some things could be reconsidered.\n\nHere's what I hope Ubuntu will add to on the GNOME experience to make it more Unity like:\n \n**1. Sane extensions** *(that I have no idea why aren't baked into GNOME by default)*\n\n* Dash to Dock\n* TopIcons\n* God damn minimize button (not an extension but should be turned on by default)\n* Pixel Saver (those huge title bars are literally a waste of vertical space Unity so graciously saved)\n\n**2. Theming**\n\n* Nice dandy Ubuntu Ambiance like theme with dark and light contrast and smaller header bars by default\n* Ubuntu font because it's so elegant (and Cantarell font not as much)\n* Ubuntu mono dark icons (or maybe Unity 8 ones?)\n\n**3. Features**\n\n* Maybe keep those relevant and very useful Nautilus patches preserving older useful features that GNOME removed.\n* The current \"Software & Updates\" and Driver Utility\n* Global Menus and HUD (although I am not expecting that would actually happen) :( \n\n**4. Saner default apps**\n\nUbuntu always had better default apps than vanilla GNOME, at least IMO. For example, Firefox is so much more better than GNOME Web. Dustin Kirkland has said that they are going to re-evaluate the default apps package so it will be nice to look forward to.\n\nEven these small changes would really go a long way to keep Ubuntu more ergonomic and elegant than what vanilla GNOME offers.

As a taste of such power allows folks to get used to it, before they move on to the real deal or stay with the simpler format.\n\n**these might be givens to you guys, but as linux dominates my engineering program by choice of the students, we are moving forward. Things are improving. If you worked on anything important in linux, brag in this thread, share it. We will show you the love you deserve today. While for others they develop projects because they are told to do so for whatever reason, linux developers develop things because theyfeel we need or want them; For ourselves or others. This is a truly beautiful thing and deserves praise.**",

And boy do I like it.\n\nMakes it a breeze to run an app as a service, logging is per-service (!), centralized/automatic status of every service, simpler/readable/smarter timers than cron.\n \nCgroups are great, they're trivial to use (any service and its child processes will automatically be part of the same cgroup).  You can get per-group resource monitoring via systemd-cgtop, and systemd also makes sure child processes are killed when your main dies/is stopped. You get all this for free, it's automatic.\n\nI don't even give a shit about init stuff (though it greatly helps there too) and I already love it. I've barely scratched the features and I'm excited.\n\nI mean, I was already pro-systemd because it's one of the rare times the community took a step to reduce the fragmentation that keeps the Linux desktop an obscure joke. But now that I'm actually using it, I like it for non-ideological reasons, too!\n\nThree cheers for systemd!",

It's hard to get a read on high schoolers - this one seemed interested but you never know if anything you say sticks. I tried to give him a good idea of the challenges and perks of my position. He seemed to have a genuine interest in PC building and tinkering, so I showed him the department where I deployed a bunch of Linux desktops, which are used for light web browsing and connections to Citrix and VMView sessions. He was helping run Windows updates in a different area and I showed him how much simpler/quicker it was to run sudo apt install update && sudo apt upgrade on Linux Mint desktops. He seemed to think that was cool. \n\nThe upgrade process completed before we went back to the Windows machine and I bet him Windows Updates still weren't done. Sure enough, they weren't. I told him about some of the other open source perks, and that he could run Steam on Linux. Pretty sure this is where I must have hooked him, because he had stated he was big into gaming.\n\nA few days later, I ran into his mom (who works with me) in the hall - \"Thanks a lot!\" ... \"What?\" ... \"Now my kid is installing Linux on all our computers at home!\" ... \"Haha, nice!\"\n\nThis isn't the first time I've extolled the virtues of GNU/Linux, but this is one of the first times I can remember where someone has really taken the ball and ran with it. Feels good.\n\nIf others have similar success stories, I'd love to hear them!\n\n*edit - typo",

Yet, I've been using Linux for about several years now,\nthough the very large chunk of it was taken up as with moderate amount of gaming, and some mild game development (the both of which are more than fine enough for me, but I digress). So after installing KXStudio onto my laptop, I plunged straight back into Linux Audio. And goddamn, did I ever regret trying this again for a third time.\n\nI've got the majority of the hardware needed. My laptop is more than capable enough of recording ~12 \"CD Quality\" audio/MIDI tracks, so that suffices plenty for me. I've got my audio interface/preamp, even if it's a bit low on price. My MIDI Keyboard/Controller should quickly suffice for a \"Generic MIDI\" driver.\n\nAnd then there's the state of every Digital Audio Workstation I tried. Literally all of them are lacking some way, for their own special reasons. LMMS doesn't even record straight audio without needing some sort of ass-backwards workaround like recording into Audacity and exporting it as a sample. Ardour still requires some depreciated wiki digging to get any sort of \"general-purpose MIDI\" setup. The only semblance of sanity for DAWs is Audacity, but that comes with one gigantic trade-off for the sake of ease: No MIDI usage.\n\nI can barely imagine any solution that isn't \"wait until somebody clones CoreAudio a decade later-oh wait that was what PulseAudio was supposed to be\". \"Use JACK and everything is perfect,\" is what virtually every Linux forum with and/or about musicians say from any poster. But it's all still communicating with hardware via ALSA and PulseAudio. And even then, trying to figure out JACK is like figuring how/why some cheap knockoff eurorack synthesizers and their problems are to be fixed. I didn't use JACK to emulate the experience of fucking euroracks. I'd like a straight-forward method that would actually allow me to quickly get shit done with and not take hours of surfing to figure out how to hook a LADSPA/VST thing to my MIDI Controller. *I don't care about the specifics.* Though if [the Ardour Wiki](https://i.imgur.com/qS4w4uF.png) is to be trusted well, apparently only I am the only one to know better (except I fucking don't).\n\n(credit to /u/netzapper for the [original rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/qymlk/after_ten_years_of_running_linux_exclusively_im/) that I very loosely derived this from, and for a post that still remains relevant today)",

I've been trying to port AOSP (Android Open Source Project) to it, but I need the kernel source code. Usually, an OEM will release the kernel sources on a website soon after the product or update is released, though it is not required. They are required to release it upon request. However, source code for the Score is not listed on ZTE's open source release site. My next step was to email ZTE about acquiring the source code, which they are REQUIRED to do. Below is my email and their reply:\n\n> L*** C*** <*******@gmail.com>\n> \t\n> 9:15 AM (7 hours ago)\n> \t\t\n> to mobile@\n> \n> To whom it may concern:\n> \n> I own a ZTE Score x500 and am an Android developer, Linux enthusiast, and Free Software Foundation supporter. I noticed that you have not released the kernel source code for the ZTE Score x500 on your Open Source bulletin webpage. I am requesting you provide me with the kernel source code for the ZTE Score x500 as required under the GPL.\n> \n> Thank you,\n> **************\n> \n> \n> mobile@zte.com.cn\n> \t\n> 9:53 AM (7 hours ago)\n> \t\t\n> to me\n> Dear Customer\n> \n> Thank you for contacting ZTE\n> \n> If you are looking for the Kernel source code than\n> \n> Please check in the below link .\n> \n> http://support.zte.com.cn/support/news/NewsMain.aspx?type=service\n> \n> If that model is not available there than we really  Sorry to inform you that we can't provide this now it may take more time depends on the technical department.\n> \n> You can also contact the local dealer where you purchased the device to or network operator to send a request to ZTE so that we can release the Kernel source code because\n> \n> ZTE is not selling any product to the customer or in the market directly.\n> \n> ZTE will sell only in bulk quantity to the network provider and to the dealer\n> \n> Should there be further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n> \n> Best Regards \n\nI contacted the carrier (Cricket) but was initially turned away, then told they would look into it, but I have doubts about it.\nZTE has been known to do this to source code they seemingly don't wish to release, even [replying with the exact email, verbatim.](http://androidforums.com/threads/closed-request-kernel-source.812658/)\n\nI would like guidance on what I should do next. At this point it's less about getting the actual source than making a manufacturer follow the licenses for FLOSS software they use.",

Its 100% open and you are not locked into using anyones service.\n\nThe protocol is distributed the same way as email, users can run their own matrix servers or join one hosted for them. Servers can fully intercommunicate with each other to exchange messages formatted in JSON\n\nThe protocol supports 1:1 chats, group chats, voice/video calling, end to end encryption, file sharing and push notifications.\n\n### How to use it\n\nTo use matrix you need to pick a client. The most feature complete client is the [riot](https://riot.im) web client and mobile apps however there is a selection of [other clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) including a plugin for [weechat](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html).\n\n### Bridges to other communities\n\nRight now matrix.org hosts bridges to other communities such as Freenode, Snoonet, OFLC, Moznet, Slack, Gitter and [more to come](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/208). This means you can use matrix to talk to people in existing channels on other services.\n\nTo connect to a channel on freenode for example you type `/join #freenode_#channelname:matrix.org`",

I was expecting the switch to be a pain in the ass so I was hesitant, but it was way easier than I expected.  A lot of the desktop environments use the same hotkeys as Windows.  As far as command line stuff goes, I was already familiar with gcc, cygwin and git bash so that made picking it up pretty easy.  \n\nNy computer is now much snappier, I'm able to customize hotkeys without the need for third party software, I can make the DE look and behave how I want and now I feel like I have control of my computer again.  There really not much I miss about windows at all.   Windows 10 made my feel like I was no longer in control of my computer.  They have made it much more difficult to perform some administrative tasks and made some things less accessible. Even more annoying was that when I downloaded one app from their store, it automatically re-installed a lot of the bloatware I had already uninstalled.  That sort of thing should be opt-in, not opt-out.\n\nMy favorite thing so far is that I can install all of the packages I want on a fresh Linux install with a script I wrote.  I can just put the names of all the packages a I want into a file, run the script, and about 30 minutes later, I have everything I want installed without having to babysit the computer as it installs.  That would literally take all day for me to do the same thing in windows, not to mention that  I would also need to spend several hours uninstalling all the windows bloatware and disabling unnecessary or insecure services.  Good guy Linux on the other hand only runs the services I need by default and doesn't install Cortana, 3d Builder, XBox services and a bunch of other garbage I don't want on my computer.  \n",

So I went to a local computer store and got the only empty USB hard drive enclosure they sold: the Clickfree C2. \n\nGot home to find it's just two flimsy bits of plastic that click together (ironic, isn't it?) with a tiny circuit board. Put in the hard drive, clicked it shut, hooked it up, waited for the thing to mount... aaaand, nothing.\n\nFired up GNOME disks to find that on the tiny circuit board there was a read only file system containing, most likely, some crappy backup software, and the 2TB disk that had previously contained one big partition encrypted with LUKS now contained unrecognised data.\n\nOne more check:\n\n    # cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdb1\n    Device /dev/sdb1 is not a valid LUKS device.\n\n    # blkid -p /dev/sdb\n    /dev/sdb: PTTYPE=\"dos\"\n\nYes. Whatever firmware is embedded in that tiny innocent looking circuit board, it has overwritten the LUKS header with a DOS partition table rendering all the data on the hard drive useless.\n\nIt's not a bug, it's a feature!\n\nI'm just glad I've got a backup.\n\nOh, and because the Clickfree enclosure clicks close (no screws), I had to break it to get my hard drive back out again.\n\nedit: formatting\n\n**Update**\n\nAs /u/Innominate8 points out in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/45acws/til_usb_hard_drive_enclosures_can_overwrite_disk/czx8205) comment, the Clickfree C2 is marketed as a backup solution, not a hard drive enclosure. Furthermore, as /u/harlows_monkeys points out in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/45acws/til_usb_hard_drive_enclosures_can_overwrite_disk/czx7mn3) comment, it seems likely that the Clickfree C2 should never have been sold empty.

            "body": "Viewing your \"about:permissions\" page in Firefox could reveal a lot of pages you only visited in \"private browsing mode\":\n\nWhile watching, for example,  a html5-video in Firefoxs private browsing mode, you get a pop-up to allow full screen and \"remember decision for [website]\" checkbox. Marking this checkbox will permanently save this decision and make the website visible in your about:permissions page in Firefox, **even after closing your private browsing window**. The same goes for other permissions you grant for the website, e.g. location, camera, etc.\nThis is - in my opinion - in contrast to logging into a website in private browsing mode, which will be forgotten by Firefox after you close the window.\n\nThis problem was discussed in Mozillas bugzilla [#967812](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=967812) over one year ago and the behavior was described as intentional:\n> This is intentional.  The permission manager is used for explicit permissions for the website that are directly granted or denied by the user through explicit actions, and therefore **we persist them in private browsing mode just like we preserve bookmarks and downloads.**       \n[#967812 Comment 1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=967812#c1)\n\nA new \"solution\"  from June of this year, by a Tor Browser developer (Tor Browser is based on Firefox) was brought up: \n> Here's the same patch updated to mozilla-central, which introduces a pref, \"permissions.memory_only\" that prevents the Permissions manager from writing to disk **(regardless of whether we are in PBM)**.         \n[#967812 Comment 9](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=967812#c9)\n\nAnd this simple preferences would probably be set to false by default, because this effects private browsing mode as well as normal browsing mode,  and this means the same behavior as it is right now.\n\nAllowing a website in private browsing mode to show videos in fullscreen and \"save this decision\" should not be saved permanently and exposure the websites visited privately in about:persmissions. In my opinion it is comparable to a websites \"remember me\" function while logging in - which will be forgotten after closing the private browser window- and is NOT comparable to bookmarks and downloads.\n\nbtw. I am using Firefox nightly and the permissions.memory_only option is not yet available in my about:config page.",

It's a non-profit that supports software users rights and promotes, you guessed it, free software. \n\nAs with most nonprofits, the funding for the FSF comes in the form of membership - a monthly/yearly contribution in exchange for being a member. For some publishing companies, this means access to their journals, but for the FSF, you get a bunch of other things. Here is a list of the ones you all might be most interested in:\n\n* Free entry to the LibrePlanet conference\n* Email forwarding (member.fsf.org email address)\n* 5% discount on hardware from [ThinkPenguin](https://www.thinkpenguin.com/)\n* [A bunch of other stuff listed here](https://fsf.org/associate/benefits)\n\nThe membership cost is $10 a month, or a lump sum of $120 dollars a year. If you are a student, that price is halved.\n\nThe best part about this? Because FSF is a 501(c)(3) charity, your membership fee is tax deductible.\n\nAlso, if you want, you can optionally receive a [slim USB membership card](https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/images/fsfcard.gif) that is loaded with Trisquel Live.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation does a lot for us, and they are about $370k under their goal for the end of the year. Please consider becoming a member, to help them continue their work.\n\n#[Join Here](https://my.fsf.org/join)",

Had I been on Windows or OSX, this would have begun like a 30min-1hr search for some software that would do it for free and not be online (uploading privacy-sensitive docs is a no-no). Google \"jpg to pdf linux\", first result mentions the command `convert *.jpg output.pdf`.\n\nHaving never seen the program `convert` before, I found and installed it, looked at the manual, and had the task done in like 2 minutes:\n\n    sudo dnf provides */convert\n    sudo dnf install ImageMagick\n    man convert\n    convert *.jpg output.pdf\n\nBoom. Done. Thanks Linux.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*edit - this was not intended as a dig at macOS or Windows. And all of the comments saying \"<insert OS here> can also convert JPGs to PDFs too!\" are completely missing the point (I'd be very worried if they couldn't). The intended message here is just how wonderful, easy, and fast the experience was. \n\nThe online community and documentation is great. The package manager works great. The program I needed (ImageMagick) is also great. All of this greatness combined to make something really easy and a great user experience. Stuff like this is why I think Linux is now to the point where it's as easy to use as macOS or Windows (I actually think it's easier, but I am definitely biased).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR** - There is no kernel but Linux and Linus is its prophet. All unbelievers will be ~~purged in holy fire~~ encouraged to run, copy, modify, and redistribute free and open-source software as we await ~~the second coming of Stallman incarnate~~ the Year of the Linux Desktop.",

Link: [Original thread by \"PalmerTech\"](http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=14777), |[screenshot](http://imgur.com/MXcDbC0)|\n2. The company started a Kickstarter where they managed to raise $2.5 million in funding for the device but it seems that any discussions pertaining to open source licensing were nowhere to be found. Link: [A blog article discussing this issue](http://robmyers.org/2013/04/26/oculus-rift-free-software/)\n3. Palmer posted a response on Reddit where he made it clear that the company now intends to maintain exclusive rights to the software and has no plans to license its SDK under LGPL or any other sort of open source license because of their research and development costs. Link: [Palmer's reply on /r/oculus subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1dfnhw/id_like_to_hear_palmer_respond_to_this_oculus_not/c9pvvwg), |[screenshot](http://imgur.com/b66DaYq)|\n\nIs he right in saying that it would be impossible to compete if they moved towards more open licensing and that doing so would be unfair because of the R&D that they have devoted to the project? As someone that has been closely been following the Oculus for months I found this quite disappointing since a product this amazing is ripe for innovation and does not deserve to be locked down to anyone who wishes to improve upon it. \n\nAre there any good examples of hardware/software companies that have been successful even though their products use open licenses?\n\n*****\n\nEdit1: Grammar. \n\nEdit2: Screenshots.\n\nEdit3:\n\n1. It seems that the issue mostly rests with the disagreements about what constitutes, or defines, open source software and open source licensing. A few concerns have been raised about the current Oculus license as-is but it has been pointed out that Palmer has mentioned that the terms are subject to change and they have yet to settle on a final license and final terms but portions may be released under the Apache license. Currently, the source can be viewed, but there are restrictions on how the SDK may be modified and distributed.\n\n2. The original second bullet also made mention that the Kickstarter was void of any promises of openness and it turns out that this was because the dynamics of the project had shifted heavily once larger key players [think large studios] showed their interest/support. There were concerns about big companies opting away from implementing and supporting the Oculus if it caused them to have to legally release more of their code than they might be comfortable with, based on the terms of some open source licenses. This might have caused trouble for the project because they would have had to deal  with hacking in support for everything individually instead of having native support from game developers into various engines. Much concern lies with how some licenses deal with derivative works.\n\n3. Suggestions have been brought up about just releasing the hardware driver alone with a more relaxed license or even a splitting into multiple versions of the SDK. The issue really boils down into a  double-edged sword in which, on the one hand, a more open license would give more freedom to the community to make more alterations, additions, and innovations to the project, but on the other hand, in doing so it would push away big players that would otherwise embrace the device which would of course could potentially be detrimental to the quick adoption of games into the virtual reality movement. As with most things, it seems that time will tell just how permissive the final version of the Oculus Rift's license will be.\n\nEdit4: Formatting.\n",

            "body": "Despite all the pros of moving from USB mass storage to MTP, the main thing that google did there is disrupting of the brittle open-source ecosystem. I guess this was written many times in every androidish blog. They fix what\u2019s not being broken with something which never worked for Linux. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m against MTP, it solves more problems than creates, taking in mind that Linux users are endangered species these days.\n\n\nWell, honestly, sometimes it works. Sometimes not. You know, when you visit your doctor, and tell her: \u00abmy leg hurts\u00bb, and she responds back: \u00abI have the very same leg, exactly like yours, and it does not hurt at all\u00bb. Basically this is what I get every time I tell anyone about MTP problems. Did I asked much? Partial reads/writes? Speedy uploads? Stable uploads?? Album covers anyone? Unicode? (*well who cares, it\u2019s well known that any files with mumbo-jumbo-\u0417\u0410\u0429\u0418\u0429\u0410\u042e\u0429\u0418\u0415\u0421\u042f in it is not music at all*).\n\n\nYes, I agree, I'm asking too much. This whole list could be shrunk to \u00abconnect less than minute\u00bb and \u00abdo not crash after every second folder uploaded\u00bb. \n\n\nThen I gave up poking in different software in different stages of *brokenness* and wrote the mtp implementation from scratch. I carefully listened to all feedback I had so far, and embedded all features I was asked for. Also I hijack this name from google (it was mentioned in android help), trying to gain some recognition. (I\u2019m still waiting for \u00abcease and desist\u00bb letter lol) And it (*writing*) took some time though, barely a \u00abbloated R&D of software giants \u00d7 second\u00bb.\n\n\nSo I kindly ask linux users of reddit to check it out and send me feedback and bugs there. (Or maybe even ask your distribution to include it!) This definitely needs to be fixed once and for all. \n\nThe sources are available on github there:\nhttps://github.com/whoozle/android-file-transfer-linux\n\nRight now it supports:\n\n* Fuse interface via partial get/set (fast)\n* Simple Qt interface\n* Unlimited object sizes (>4Gb)\n* Fast (~20Mb/s)\n* Auto-preparation of album covers for android media server.\n\nAnd many small features too small to mention here.\n\nPhew\u2026 thank you very much, now I feel much better. :)\n\nPS The same applies for Microsoft, but at least they don\u2019t use Linux and other open-source crapware if it could be an excuse. :)\n\nPPS I\u2019ve been told that Lumia phones work only with AFS under linux.\n",

            "body": "1999:\n\nUsing Windows (98), never gave it much thought, because I wasn't aware of alternatives.\n\n2007:\n\nFinally tinker with my first \"user-friendly\" Linux distro. Hated it. It looked nice, but it was horribly unstable and just not a good experience. Went back to Windows (XP).\n\n2008-2010:\n\nStarting to become annoyed with Windows. Tinkered with various Linux distros again, in the hopes of finding one that I could work with. All \"user-friendly\", all with way too many issues. Give up within days every single time, and returned to Windows (Vista).\n\n2014:\n\nWindows 8.1 actively ignores or fights against my every move. It restarts after I specifically tell it not to, corrupting file transfers that were in progress. Explorer crashes at least once every 30 minutes. The system updates during most shutdowns/reboots. The charms bar keeps popping up in my way all the time. Why am I forced to use a touchscreen interface? I'm on a computer, not a smartphone!\n\nBy late 2014, I've had enough. If this is the direction Microsoft is headed, I **must** find an alternative. Apple creates adware like iTunes, so I can't go that way either. I can't even handle \"newbie\" Linux, so I guess I'm pretty much screwed.\n\nOne last attempt before I give up entirely. As a morbid joke, I decide to try an \"expert-level\" Linux distro, just to see how bad things can get. Slackware seems to carry this reputation especially.\n\nFive minutes into installation, I realize this is the most intuitive OS I have ever touched. Everything is simple, everything is clearly explained. It's very nearly hand-holding in its simplicity, yet it's not patronizing. It's completely transparent, so I find myself learning new things without even trying.\n\nI have this sense of dread that I'm going to encounter \"expert-level\" difficulties any second. Instead, everything just keeps getting easier. The package-management could not be more straight-forward. Ditto for upgrading, ditto for installing third-party packages. I learn how the system works, one step at a time. None of it is difficult, all of it is enjoyable. It is also extremely stable. I leave my laptops on for weeks at a time without issue.\n\nEverything I have tried to do with this OS has been simple, fun, and taught me something new in the process. I grow more impressed with it every day. I could go on for hours. Quite frankly, it makes me feel like a kid again; I forgot what it was like to actually enjoy using my computer, and learning about it, instead of constantly fighting with it!\n\n2015:\n\nI use Slackware for everything. On the rare occasions I have to boot into Windows, I am instantly frustrated at the sheer difficulty of getting it to do anything useful. Just as I am nearing a complete migration (uprooting ~15 years of my Windows ecosystem), Windows 10: Spyware Edition appears on the horizon. I am thrilled to finally take back control of my computer and drop Windows entirely.\n\nI am an \"end-user\", straight from Windows 8.1, who just wants things to work. I also like to learn. These two attitudes are not mutually exclusive. I want things to be easy, *and* I want things to be transparent. I don't like when simple actions are hidden beneath layers of complexity, for the sake of making things (supposedly) easier for me. Windows is on that path, OSX is on that path, and it's increasingly clear that even Linux is on that path. But that style of design never makes things easier for me. In fact, it has only served to prevent me from switching to Linux for almost a decade!\n\nThe people creating these \"user-friendly\" interfaces obviously don't understand what those words mean. In Slackware, I have finally found something truly user-friendly. The installation was more friendly and helpful than any other I have ever encountered. It doesn't treat me like an idiot. It gives me helpful recommendations, but it always respects my choices. It never gets in my way.\n\nSlackware is the best Operating System I have ever used, and I sincerely hope it will survive the storm of \"user-friendly\".",

Some kind of hardware issue, as I don't even get a BIOS screen.\n\nBeing in the middle of a project I don't have time to piece swap to see what the piece is that went bad, power supply, maybe, mother board, maybe, anyway, it would have been a dust bunny swap fest to get the machine up and running again.\n\nI pull the hard drive out of the old machine, plug it into the new machine, with totally new different hardware, and it comes up without a tweak.  Video card is cool (I did go from Nvidia to Nvidia but different models), Audio works, Graphics great, Speed awesome, again, I JUST PLUGGED IT IN AND IT WORKED.\n\nWindows, that was installed dual boot on the same hard drive didn't fare quite as well :p\n\nAnyway, go *nix.

In fact I probably use the same lame excuse like most of us here: \"Sorry, I don't know Windows anymore\". Lately though... I could not watch my poor dad any longer trying to restore Windows 10 on what used to be a laptop. And is now basically a warm picture frame. Don't ask me how Windows 10 landed on there. Apparently other family and friends have access to his laptop and one of them convinced him to get Windows 10 and a $150 MS-Office copy.\n\nAnyway even after removing all the bloat the processor could barely move the mouse cursor. Eventually I gave up and threw Xubuntu 16.04 on the laptop. Turns out the laptop had enough power for word processing. The things he wanted to do like printing, text documents and browsing all suddenly work. The printer driver installation was a bit rough though. Only found some old `deb.sh` for Ubuntu 10.04... For some reason scans are flipped vertically?\n\nSo yeah. A few weeks later, a bit surprisingly this thing did not blow up in my face. The only problem is that his friends and grandchildren can't install software from the internet.\n\nPS: One minor drawback though is that I had to nope my way out once. One of my dads friends suggested I have a look at his computer and CDs :-)",

Yes, pancakes - had none of those available.\n\n\nWell to those of you who had any kind of part in this, I'm extremely grateful for your work and dedication. Thank you!",

But the main drive was a slow and small 5200rpm laptop drive.\nToday I inserted my spare 1.5TB drive and booted up. Wanted the system on this bigger faster drive instead.\n\nOld approach: boot on a usb-stick so drives are unmounted, and do \"dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdc\".\n\nLVM approach: add /dev/sdc to the volume group, then run \"pvmove /dev/sda\". This moves all data from sda to other drives (only sdc available). No need to reboot, no need to unmount. While I'm writing this, the data is being moved.\n\nLater, do \"vgreduce megatron /dev/sda\" to remove the slow drive from the volume group and voila. Data moved. (megatron is the name of the volume group and of my computer).\n\nThis might be old news to many but I just thought this was really cool :)\n\nEDIT: Fixed the link and corrected vgmove -> pvmove",

Its quality however is a different story.\n\nSomething is not right about this if statement:\n\n    if (sscanf(buf, \"%i\", &mode) != 1 || (mode != 2 || mode != 1))\n        return -EINVAL;\n\nDo you see it?\nThe sub-expression `(mode != 2 || mode != 1)` can give us these values depending on `mode`:\n\n* `mode` = 2 ==> (FALSE || TRUE) == TRUE\n* `mode` = 1 ==> (TRUE || FALSE) == TRUE\n* `mode` is somethig other than 1, 2 ==> (TRUE || TRUE) == TRUE\n* `mode` is 1 and 2 at the same time ==> that can't happen\n\nWith this in mind, we can rewrite the whole statement like this:\n\n    if (sscanf(buf, \"%i\", &mode) != 1 || TRUE)\n\nWhich can be rewritten further to (**EDIT**):\n\n    sscanf(buf, \"%i\", &mode);\n    if (TRUE)\n\nThat means the function is effectively disabled because it always returns `-EINVAL`.\n\nOther problems I found with the commit:\n\n* no sign-off line from Nick\n* the commit message asks a question\n* an extra space before `||`\n\nThankfully, this function only handles a sysfs interface for Toshiba keyboard backlight mode.\n\n---\n\n[previous post about Nick](http://reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2corc0/just_in_case_hes_a_reddit_troll/)\n\n---\n\nEDIT 2:\n\n* this commit is included in linux v3.17-rc1, only the [Toshiba ACPI driver](http://memebeam.org/toys/ToshibaAcpiDriver) is affected\n* the code was wrong even before Nick's patch (performed no input validation)\n* the if statement validates values that are written to this (virtual) file `/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/TOS1900:00/kbd_backlight_mode`",

            "body": "Hello.  Its louis here.  I'm clacking this to you on my phone in my dressing room here at studio 8H, right in 30 rockefeller center, in Manhattan, new york city, new york, america, world, current snapshot of all existence everywhere.\n\nTonight I'm hosting Saturday Night Live, something I zero ever in my life saw happening to me. And yet here it is completely most probably happening (I mean, ANYTHING could NOT happen.  So we'll see).\n\nI've been working here all week with the cast, crew, producers and writers of SNL, and with Lorne Michaels. Such a great and talented group of people.\n\nAnd here we are in the middle of New York City, which was just slammed by a hurricane, leaving behind so much trouble, so much difficulty and trauma, which everyone here is still dealing with every day.\n\nLast night we shot some pre-tape segments in greenwich Village, which was pitch black dark for blocks and blocks, as it has been for a week now.\n\nIts pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness.  It can't even be called a trip through time, because as long as new york has lived, its been lit. By electricity, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene.  But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, to walk through the heart of it and feel like, in a way, it was dead.   I can't tell you how that felt.  And you also had a palpable sense that inside each dark window was a family or a student or an artist or an old woman living alone, just being int he dark and waiting for the day to come back. Like we were all having one big sleep over, but not so much fun as that.\n\nThis is how a lot of the city is still.  I know people in queens, brooklyn, Staten Island, new jersey, all over, are not normal yet.  And not normal is hard.\n\nAnd here at 30 rock, these folks are working so hard this week.  There are kids in the studio every day, because members of the crew and staff had to bring them to work.   Many people are sharing lodging.  Everyone is tired.  But there's this feeling here that we've got to put on a great show.  I'm sure it feels like that here every week.  But wow.  I feel really lucky to be sharing this time with these particular good folks here at SNL.\n\nIn about 5 hours we'll be going on the air.   I'll do a monologue.  And we'll show you some sketches that we wrote and try to make you laugh.   I'm gonna look really dumb in some of this stuff.  But I don't care. Its awfully worth it. And I'm really excited.\n\nAnyway.  I just wanted to let you know.  If you watch the show tonight, when Don Pardo says my name and you see me walking out, all the shit in this email is what ill be thinking.  I'm a pretty lucky guy.   I hope you enjoy the show.\n\nThanks.\n\nLouis C.K.\n\nLive.  From new york.  Its saturday night.",

            "body": "I know every Friend episode by heart. I watched each and every one of them more than once to come up with this total, which includes past sex partners that are just mentioned. Detailed Excel spreadsheet and everything. I wish someone would do a graphic representation of this. ([Here](http://imgur.com/rawrv) is the only graph I attempted.)\n\nThis is the general data:\n\nConfirmed sex (either by strong innuendo or plain admission) = 1. \nUnconfirmed sex (e.g., 'I dated a guy...') = 0,5.\n\n* Chandler: 10.5 sex partners\n* Ross: 14 sex partners\n* Monica: 14.5 sex partners\n* Rachel: 15.5 sex partners\n* Phoebe: 32.5 sex partners\n* Joey: 51.5 sex partners\n\nSome trivia:\n\n* In episode 22 of Season 2 (\"The One with the Two Parties\"), Joey took the lead in sex partner count and there was no way back.\n* Joey and Ross have taken part in threesomes. (EDIT: As several redditors pointed out, Ross' threesome wasn't really real. The *other* woman taking part (Susan) wasn't included in Ross' stats, so the numbers are fine. No worries. Thankfully, the universe isn't going to implode.)\n* Season 6 was definitely the quietest sex-wise. **Only 4.5 new sex partners** are discovered.\n* During Season 1, Monica is the most promiscuous character (with **9.5 sex partners** discovered). In Season 3 Joey breaks this record, with 10.5 new sex partners discovered.\n* Chandler holds the record for LESS new partners discovered continuously. After having sex with Monica (end of Season 4), no new sex partners are discovered until the end of the series (i.e., 6 seasons with no new sex partners mentioned.) Regarding Monica, we discover in episode 11 of Season 7 (\"The One with All the Cheesecakes\") that she had had sex with Stuart, her cousin's new husband.\n* Phoebe surpasses Joey in new sex partners' discoveries in 4 seasons (1, 6, 8 and 10).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**TL;DR: I've carried out a profound study on Friends' sex life and sharing some info makes me feel less of a moron.**\n\nEDIT: Wow, what a beautiful response. I have now uploaded my Excel spreadsheet with all the details. Click [here](http://www.filedropper.com/friendssexstats) to download (I couldn't find any other better/quicker way to share it.) It includes the **name, episode of first mention and comments of each sex partner of each Friend** (quite organized, of course. Comment cells in grey indicate \"unconfirmed sex\" (or \"half sex\", the term I used in the spreadsheet). The second tab or sheet (named \"stats per season\" is exactly that: a summary of the data but in numeric form, per season. It includes the graph, of course.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nEDIT 2: Well, this post has been featured in several media outlets, which is pretty cool.\n\nHere are some links posted by redditors:\n\n* http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2257626/The-Friends-characters-slept-135-people-10-years-The-complicated-sexual-web-everyones-favorite-television-friends.html\n* http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/friends-sex-partners-numbers-chart.html\n* http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-wait-is-over-someone-calculated-how-many-peopl,90450/\n* http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/64701/the-number-of-sexual-partners-on-friends \n* http://www.glamour.com/sex-love-life/blogs/smitten/2013/01/wanna-know-exactly-how-many-pe.html?mbid=social_fb_fanpage \n* http://gothamist.com/2013/01/04/how_many_sexual_partners_did_the_ch.php\n* http://www.slate.fr/lien/66853/combien-partenaires-sexuels-heros-friends-joey-rachel-phoebe-monica-ross (from France!)\n\nSince I don't have much else to offer, I thought some of you might be interested in a [screenshot of the spreadsheet](http://i.imgur.com/Fh9Sw.jpg).\n\nPretty cool, uh?\n\nEDIT 3: Now you can read the FULL list of Friend's sexual partners right here in Reddit: http://redd.it/1628b4\n\nEnjoy!",

But as I watched my obligatory 20 minutes of previews in the theater tonight, fully half of the trailers showed too much of the movie.\n\nEven ones that started out catching my interest, quickly lost it when I saw so much that I was able to identify generic plot arcs. \n\nThe fact that you folks continue to foist crappy gimmicks on us only proves you hold us in contempt and find us to be stupid.\n\nStill, I'm an average guy, so if you're losing me, you're losing others too.\n\nEDIT: A lot of great responses (even most of the negative ones). To clarify, I don't hate trailers out of hand.  I love the whole movie-going experience including the trailers. It's just I think trailers over the past few years have generally (not all mind you as some are quite good) gotten too anti-climactic in terms of the films they're designed to promote because they give away too much of the story.\n\nAnd while I realize it's not a new phenomenon, it does seem (to me anyway) more (and increasingly) prevalent these days.\n\nEDIT #2: Numerous folks have made a point throughout this thread that the marketing philosophy is people won't go see a film unless they know what it's about..\n\nI think the best response is this:\n\nThere is a big difference between making a trailer that gives an enticing idea of what the film is about, thereby leading to a moviegoer deciding to buy a ticket...or making a trailer that gives away the whole movie.

Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is making a very good living as a Looper, until one day they send a target back through time that he recognizes \u2013 his future self (Bruce Willis).\n\nReal movie I'm seeing on Tuesday. I'll report back with my findings... for science.\n\n\n**EDIT:** For those of you still interested. It was Amazing with a capital A. The NDA doesn't let me go into much detail, but think (12 Monkeys + Terminator) x Frequency and you have a vague idea of it. I'm certain time travel fans everywhere will approve.\n\n**Also,** for those concerned about the whole JGL -> Brude Willis transformation.

Please correct me on any of these points so I can be a little less depressed:\n\n1. I think the trip they embarked on was all of 120 miles or something like that. And the radiator hose breaks. Again. I have had 6 cars and they have come and gone for numerous reasons. I have never had a radiator hose \"break\" that I know of. This thing breaks every other show. \n\n2. It broke while going slow through the stopped cars. They couldn't take an alternate route because they were too low on gas. Again wasn't this just a 120 mile trip? \n\n3. Crossbow guy wants a motorcycle - cool. But how loud a bike do you really want to be driving? \n\n4. Only one guy goes on the roof to watch for zombies. Somehow he only sees them when they are right on the group. \n\n5. No signal system to alert the others.\n\n6. Black guy has wandered way up ahead. Almost kills himself as he... tries to sit down? \n\n7. Kids are \"exploring\". In a zombie-infested world. The kids are exploring. \"Stay where I can see you honey...\". How about \"stay tied to my back\"?\n\n8. Zombies can't smell all these humans and walk on by for the most part.\n\n9. The blond in the RV tries to assemble a gun that she doesn't know how to assemble, when all she needed to do was be quiet.\n\n10. Zombie sees the girl and chases. One guy runs off to help her? One? The mom doesn't run along also? \n\n11. The mom doesn't join the first search. Just a couple guys. \n\n12. The next day they set out *with the sun high in the sky*. Really you guys slept in with a little girl missing? They get into some big debate about giving blond her gun or not. Again, a girl is missing folks. \n\n13. They go looking for her single file. They aren't spread out whatsoever to maximize their search.\n\n14. Disable church megaphone rather than calling the girl on it. After 24 hours don't you just go all out and risk attracting zombies to find her?\n\n15. Oh now let's stop and pray. How dumb would the mom feel if they arrived 10 seconds too late to save her daughter, all from stopping to pray?\n\n15. Now let's talk about the affair we had. \n\n16. Now let's talk about running away.\n\n17. Now the sheriff needs to pray. No rush.\n\n18. More debate over giving blond a gun. \n\n19. Ooh a deer. Go ahead kid, walk up to it. We have nothing better to do. Hey it isn't running away (which would sound alarm bells in my head). Oh wow a hunter saw the deer, but not us, shot the deer right at that moment and the bullet went right through and hit you. What are the odds. \n\nI'll keep watching because zombies. But man this is some sad writing IMO.",

Right down to the clit.\"\n\"Usher is the one who took you under his wing. You're the worst thing that Usher has done to America, since the guy who sat John Wilkes Booth behind Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n**Ludacris**\n\"The Brazilian prostitute that claimed she was with Justin told the news that he was well endowed. And that prostitute would know because so was he.\"\n\"You're not tough, Justin. I'm here to let you know that. I know you've been on Ellen 14 times. You act so much like a pussy on the show, Ellen tried to eat you.\"\n\n**Natasha Leggero**\n\"Justin's fans are called Beliebers, because these days it's considered politically incorrect to use the term retards.\"\n\"Justin, Selena Gomez had to fuck you. She is literally the least lucky Selena in all of entertainment history.\"\n\n**Shaq**\n\"Last year you were ranked the fifth most hated person of all time. Kim Jong-un didn't even score that low, and he uses your music to fuckin' torture people.\"\n\n**Chris D'Elia**\n\"Why are you here? This is a terrible idea. You're about to get fucked harder than Orlando Bloom fucked Selena Gomez.\"\n\"You're such a bitch, you have a bigger clit than the one Bruce Jenner wants.\"\n\"I'm proud of you. You have it all. You literally are a guy who has it all \u2014 except for respect, love, friends, good parents, and a Grammy.\"\n\n**Ron Burgundy**\n\"This kid has spunk, moxie, and probably a few other STDs.\"\n\"People refer to Mr. Bieber as a kid or a boy. Well here's a news flash, gang: He's a man. A full-grown man, who works and loves and makes things with his hands. A man who sings songs for 9-year-olds and cuts his hair like a gay figure skater.\"\n\n**Martha Stewart**\n\"Justin, you have no idea what you're in for. I'm sure it's great to have 60 million followers on Twitter, but the only place people will be following you in jail is into the shower.\"\n\n**Jeff Ross**\n\"You've become a cocky little shit. You are the King Joffrey of pop.\"\n\"Selena Gomez wanted to be here, but she\u2019s dating men now. Is it true you dumped her because she grew a mustache before you?\"\n\"If Anne Frank had heard your music, she would've Uber'd to Auschwitz.\"\n\"Lately a lot of people have been pointing their fingers at you \u2014 and those are just lesbians showing the barber how they want their haircut.\"\n\n**Snoop Dogg**\n\"You have left so many horrible and unwatchable videos, you should change your name to Vanilla ISIS.\"\n\"When you get to the county jail, hear me, you're gonna be the first dude who ever had a girlfriend and a boyfriend named Gomez.\"\n\n**Hannibal Buress**\n\"I hate your music more than Bill Cosby hates my comedy.\"",

While first thinking it was a crazy idea, I started to consider if it would actually be something people would watch, and if I should sell the idea to a TV-station. The idea is as follows:\n\n\n11 gay men and 1 straight man are locked in a house, like in Big Brother. The object for the gay men is to find out who is straight. Once a week someone gets outvoted, until 2 men are left, or the straight man is out. If the gays manage to outvote him, they win 1 million dollars. If the straight man is among the 2 last people in the house in the end, he wins 1 million dollars.\n\n*Now here's the twist:* None of the men are actually gay, they just all think they are the straight man.\n\n**TLDR:** Straight men behaving like homosexuals on TV.\n\n\nSo, r/entertainment, would you watch a show like this?\n",

Many people have asked me to post this list, so here it goes. Ordered by appearance or first mention, per Friend:\n\n**Chandler (10.5 sexual partners):**\n\n* Janice\n* Aurora (ep. 01-06)\n* Nina Bookbinder (01-16)\n* Jade (02-05) (Chandler wasn't as good as Bob, and much more bumpy) \n* Susie 'Underpants' Moss (02-13)\n* Girl who though Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia (02-18)\n* Mary Angela Tribbiani (might not have been full-on sex. That's the .5)\n* Joanna (They took the relationship to the next level, alright)\n* Kathy (Joey's ex)\n* Marjorie (04-20, from the sleep clinic)\n* Monica.\n\n\n**Ross (14 sexual partners):**\n\n* Carol\n* Julie \n* Rachel\n* Chloe (03-15)\n* Bonnie (03-25)\n* Emily\n* Janice (05-12)\n* Elizabeth\n* Lady who cleaned his dorm in college (07-04) (Ross mentions it himself, although that would mean he was lying when he said Carol had been the only woman he'd slept with. Shall we blame the writers?)\n* Whitney (07-05) (Hums While He Pees' ex-wife. Hurt Ross' back a little.)\n* Girl with whom Ross was caught having sex in the paleontology section of the school's library (07-07)\n* Mona\n* Girl who dumped Ross during sex (08-15)\n* Charlie Wheeler\n\n\n**Monica (14.5 sexual partners):**\n\n* Paul 'The Wine Guy'\n* Alan (01-03) (When Rachel mentions his possible penis size, Monica's reaction suggests she knows)\n* Steve (01-03) (No further reference; counts as .5)\n* Jason Hurley (01-04)\n* Kevin Millmore (01-05) (Suggests he broke up with her repeatedly; seems fair to assume there was sex)\n* Pool table guy (01-07)\n* Fun Bobby\n* Howard, the 'I win' guy\n* Scotty Jared (01-14)\n* Ethan (01-22) (Sex with a minor!)\n* Richard Burke\n* Julio (03-11)\n* Pete Becker\n* Chandler\n* Stuart (07-11) (Her cousin's now-husband)\n\n\n**Rachel (15.5 sexual partners):**\n\n* Barry Finkle (Farber)\n* Tony Demarco (01-01) (Monica references him as a very passionate (yet shallow) thing, and Rachel replies suggestively)\n* Paolo\n* Pete 'The Weeper' Carny (01-14, also referenced in 02-18)\n* Adam Ritter (01-14) (Rachel was keeping his boxer shorts as a souvenir)\n* Billy Dreskin (01-17, confirmed in 02-18)\n* Guy whose cat didn't like Rachel (02-03) ('Stopped seeing me' is the reference. Counts as .5)\n* Stevie Fisher's dad (02-05) (It is suggested that she 'fooled around' with him. Counts as .5)\n* Ross (In 02-18 she supposedly mentions all of her sexual partners; however, since she didn't mention Adam Ritter, we assume she could have also forgotten 'Guy whose cat didn't like Rachel' and Stevie Fisher's dad, above)\n* Tommy (03-22) (By the way they sort of cuddled in the coffee house, there could have been sex at some point. Counts as .5)\n* Josh (04-05) (College guy; not to be confused with Joshua. Since he stole money from her, we assume 'he might have had access'.  Counts as .5)\n* Patrick (04-10) (He flung Rachel)\n* Joshua (04-20) (In 04-18 Rachel was going to have sex with him for the 1st time; in this episode she says there's a great physical connection with him. She's exaggerating, but it seems logical that there was sex.)\n* Chip Matthews (05-08) (In this episode we find out that he and Rachel 'already kind of did it' and that next time 'it'll last for an entire song' = sex)\n* Paul Stevens (06-21, sex confirmed in 06-23)\n* Charlie (07-01) (She went to 3rd base with Monica's cousin. There could have been sex before or after. Counts as .5  anyway)\n* Tag Jones (07-12) (By this time they're shown as an established couple)\n* Teacher (07-18) (She got under him)\n\n\n**Phoebe (32.5 sexual partners):**\n\n* Carl (01-01) (The chalk-eater. Since she cared so much about him, we assume there must've been sex)\n* Jason Hurley (01-04) (Slept with him 1 hour after he broke up with Monica)\n* Tony (01-04)\n* Milwaukee guy (01-07)\n* David (the scientist guy)\n* Roger (01-13)\n* Puppet guy (01-13) (Mentioned by Joey's dad. Also mentioned in 02-19)\n* Nokolulu-nk-a-ah (sp?) (01-14) (Phoebe was keepin a dinner recepit; we assume that since she kept it but at the same time she kinda hated him, they must've had sex)\n* Guy who dumped her because she fell asleep during Spinal Tap (02-03) (Counts as .5)\n* Scott (02-07) (AKA Joey's God)\n* Rob Donan (02-12) (We only see kisses, but something more might have easily happened in between. Counts as .5)\n* Ryan (02-23) (The Navy guy)\n* Unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor (03-11)\n* Vince (03-23)\n* Larry (05-07) (She was pretty turned on by the badge and wasn't afraid of showing it during their dates, so we assume there was sex)\n* Gary (05-17)\n* Guy she married in Vegas (06-01) (It's only fair to assume that if she married someone in Vegas, she slept with him. However, this whole story is really really vague. Counts as .5)\n* Kenny, the copy boy (06-08) (Suggested to Rachel that getting laid with him would help her. She knew)\n* Kyle 'Hums While He Pees' (07-05)\n* Guy with whom she had a date three days ago (07-15) (Not a date. Just friends getting together and having sex)\n* Jake (07-18) (By the location of the hickey, it's fair to assume there was sex)\n* Tim (08-05) (She was pretty eager to have sex with him. It's not completely clear if they did fornicate. Counts as .5)\n* Short crazy guy (08-11)\n* Don (08-16) ('A girl's gotta eat')\n* Parker (08-18) (At night he treats her like the naughty girl she is)\n* Guy with whom she was having sex when she broke her leg (08-23) (There was a typo in a sex manual. Since we haven't seen her with a broken leg, we assume this guy is 'new' to the list)\n* Mike Hannigan\n* Pablo D\u00edaz (10-06) ('Dated' is the reference. However, judging by some of the other names (and references) in Phoebe's book, there could have been some action. Counts as .5)\n* Brady Smith (10-06) (*idem*.

However, judging by some of the other names (and references) in Phoebe's book, there could have been some action. Counts as .5)\n* Jethro Tull (10-06) (JT is a band of 5 members. By Phoebe's reaction, we assume she engaged in sexual acts with all of them)\n\n\n**Joey (51.5 sexual partners):**\n\n* Andrea (01-01) (Chandler says 'Andrea is the screamer'; we assume she doesn't just *randomly* screams)\n* Angela (01-05)\n* Women's room of the New York City Library's girl (01-07)\n* Sandy (01-10) (Hot single mom at the store)\n* Angela Delvecio (01-12) (Could be the same Angela from 01-05; however, she didn't look Italian, so we're counting Delvecio as a separate sex partner)\n* Lorraine (01-14) (We assume they had sex after/before/during licking chocolate mousse off each other)\n* Melanie (01-24)\n* Lori (02-10) (This fornication gave Joey his role as Dr. Drake Ramorey)\n* Erica (02-12) (We assume the hand licking led to something else; plus, Joey told her she was the only one.

            "body": "In a recent [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2017/03/27/tesla-tsla-valuable-ford/) post, the news is delivered with understatement: Tesla now has a larger market capitalization than Ford Motor Company.\n\nHowever, the article makes certain points that are worth thinking about before the enthusiasm gets out of hand: Namely that market cap is a measure of stock value rather than necessarily the fundamentals of a company, although those too are continuously increasing for Tesla as it builds out its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, solar panel factory in New York, and various other facilities.\n\nFord remains overwhelmingly dominant compared to Tesla in its pace of manufacturing and delivery, and yet the news is a milestone in a trend that has been unfolding for years.  Tesla has been continuously advancing its ability to produce, and despite occasional dips in stock price, the stock has kept well ahead of the shockwave.\n\nA company that was not supposed to exist according to...well...*everyone*...now has a market capitalization of $45 billion, after a decade and a half of growth and hard-fought survival at times.  But here's where the future interest comes into light: Tesla is no longer \"merely\" a car company.\n\nTesla is growing both up and down its own supply chain - expanding across its own entire industrial sector - entering the energy production, energy storage, and energy management industries that will increase the value of its cars.  It is also *creating* an entire industrial science of the factory-as-product, rooted in designing whole factories as if they were single products limited only by the basic laws of physics.\n\nA lot of OEM companies extend tendrils into their own supply chains, but these are usually just hedges - they maintain a basic capacity to serve their own needs if a major supplier has a serious interruption.  And, of course, as leverage in negotiations with their suppliers if someone is trying to strong-arm them.  That is not what Tesla is doing.\n\nTesla is out for conquest.  Having watched this company evolve since a decade ago, and watched its vision evolve, I can say that it intends - over the longest term - to become the world's dominant producer of clean energy infrastructure, related systems, and the building and transport technologies that utilize it.\n\nDisaster is entirely possible when ambitions are so grand, and Tesla has averted it so often that one has to wonder if Musk's genius is not mixed in with some strain of adrenaline-driven recklessness, but sooner or later you have to admit that the best guide to what someone will achieve in the future is what they have already achieved in the past.\n\nTesla has the tools, the talent, and the ambition to own the world.  I think they will.  They will change the energy and transport systems of the world, and possibly the basic way in which we manufacture on a large scale.  Over decades, I think they will surpass all other automakers, and then surpass them all *combined*, beginning to then challenge companies like Apple and Google - who have themselves shown awareness of the danger by experimenting with entering the auto market.  The world's first trillion-dollar company may be among us.\n\nBut knock on wood.  Knock on it soundly.",

He lays the facts on the line and lets the public decide what is right and what is wrong, even if it pisses people off.\n\nWith advancements in technology there **IS** going to be unemployment, a lot, how much though remains to be seen.  When massive amounts of people are unemployed through no fault of their own there needs to be a safety net in place to avoid catastrophe.\n  \nWe need to spread the word as much as possible, even if you think its pointless.  Someone is listening!\n\nWould r/Futurology be interested in him doing a show covering automation and a possible solution -Basic Income?  \n\nEdit: A lot of people seem to think that since we've had automation before and never changed our economic system (communism/socialism/Basic Income etc) we wont have to do it now.  Yes, we have had automation before, and no, we did not change our economic system to reflect that, however, whats about to happen HAS never happened before.  Self driving cars, 3D printing (food,retail, construction) , Dr. Bots, Lawyer Bots, etc. are all in the research stage, and will (mostly) come about at roughly the same time.. Which means there is going to be MASSIVE unemployment rates ALL AT ONCE.  Yes, we will create new jobs, but not enough to compensate the loss.\n\nEdit: Maybe I should post this video here as well **Humans need not Apply** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU\n\nEdit: If you guys really want to have a Basic Income Episode tweet at John Oliver.  His twitter handle is @iamjohnoliver     https://twitter.com/iamjohnoliver\n\nEdit: Also visit /r/basicincome \n\nEdit: check out /r/automate \n\nEdit: Well done guys!

And I damn well don't want to miss it by a decade or so. I want Kurzeil to see it. \n\nPolitical corruption is inefficiency. At this point, I'm blatantly asking for financial support and in doing so, I'll reduce my quality of life in outrageous respects by publicly broadcasting myself at all time and from all angles. I'll reduce my diet to rice and protein shakes (if the hivemind so declares). I'll read the damn bills in their entirety. I'll make weekly youtube fireside chats and speak very candidly and with lots of cursing. I will explain my reasoning and seek intelligent discourse. I'll spend eight hours a day answering skype questions and studying economics or whatever the sub-reddit decides.\n\nI'm volunteering every piss, fart and dirty picture I google. I have no shame. I want to see heat death and there is no price too high.\n\nI want you to know that I understand how silly and immature an idea this comes across as, especially by those whose opinions I hold in regard. But they are wrong and I'll subject myself to ridicule and examination to prove so.  I think even the incredibly intelligent are likely to mistake the curve for a line. \n\nNow is the time to be desperate. You are under-estimating. Careers will dry up quicker than an old dog can learn new tricks. Driving will now longer be a viable profession in 5-10 years. It will only get worse from there. That's why my platform would be framed around basic income and automation. The current stock of front-runners are miles from the real and brutal conversations we should have been having ten years ago. \n\nInvent your insanely educated, sub-subservient politician and I'll do it as decided upon. I need the minimum payment on my debts and enough for food and shelter. I'm pretty damn drunk at this point so don't be surprised if I'm very embarrassed about this in the morning, but sober me is a puss and don't listen to him.\n\nEdit: oh geez, I forgot I did this. I'll try to respond to everything after work.\n\nEdit2: Let me start off with that I don't actually want to do this. The idea of it scares me senseless. Nor am I particularly well qualified, but I'm willing to work hard to be so. I'm not really killing it at life or superbly financially responsible. I have some anxiety and depression (and kinda froze up at the response this got). But I feel compelled to try anyway, (especially while drinking apparently). And there is no harm in trying other than a lifetime of embarrassment for me, my friends and family.\n\nI first I was pretty discouraged with overwhelming negative responses, but hey, upvotes don't lie so I guess I'm going to go forward with it over at /r/automationparty. I'm currently traveling home for the holidays but over the next few days I'm going to copy the good questions here and put them into an FAQ over there.\n\nIf you're onboard with this idea at all, please consider uping [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/newreddits/comments/3y12en/automation_party_im_considering_running_for/) thread as I don't want to clutter r/futurology any further.

            "body": "Every so often an article gets posted here about the state of these devices. These often end up being quite heated arguments between groups of people (on all sides) that are working with partial information, are conflating speculation with what we know, and that misunderstand what scientists are actually looking at.\n\nSo, because this will continue to be a hot topic, and because Eagleworks will be conducting more experiments in full vacuums soon, I wanted to collect what information has actually been revealed, not what has been speculated in sensationalist articles, echo chambers, and comment sections.\n\nLet me be clear, although I described the news articles as sensationalist, the facts as we currently know them are ALSO quite sensational.\n\n## EmDrive vs. Cannae Drive\n\nThe EmDrive and the Cannae Drive are **two different things**. They were independently invented by two people. The EmDrive was invented by Roger J. Shawyer, a British aerospace engineer who has a background in defense work as well as experience as a consultant on the Galileo project (a European version of the GPS system).\n\nThe Cannae Drive was invented by Guido P. Fetta and was formerly known as the Q-Drive.\n\nThey both are claimed to use a ~~specially shaped cavity, with constricted openings,~~ cone shaped cavity in metal, closed at **both** ends, and operate by using some form of electromagnetic radiation in the microwave spectrum to generate a directional force. The EmDrive is claimed to receive its force from the shape of the cavity, while the Cannae drive was claimed to receive its force from the shape of the cavity, and from specially shaped \"slots\" on the inside of the cavity.\n\nThe EmDrive has been tested in a laboratory twice independently (once by a team at the China Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in Xi'an, and once by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center), under different conditions and setups, while the Cannae Drive has only been independently tested once by Eagleworks.\n\nAlthough they are independently invented, and different in shape, and the inventors claim different effects are the cause of the resulting force, because of their similarities in concept and mode of operation, as well as the particular method of interacting with the microwaves, it is likely that if they work they operate on the same principle regardless of what the inventors claim.\n\n## The Inventors Claims\n\nBoth inventors claim that their devices do not actually violate any physics, and instead take advantage of very particular but speculative aspects of existing physics. **It is important to note that while both theories are being tested, Eagleworks is testing whether or not the devices work as a SEPARATE thing from why they work.**\n\nShawyer claims that the EmDrive works only on radiation pressure. Light is both wave-like and particle-like. Though it has no mass, it does have momentum, and the fact that light exerts a very small force on the objects it interacts with is well documented.\n\nShawyer claims that the pressure exerted by light is a result of the group velocity of the wave, not the singular velocity of the the photon that interacts. He then uses this to contend that radiation pressure is actually a Lorentz force. As scientists understand it now, the momentum of a photon is related to phase velocity, while group velocity measures the propagation of information.\n\nFetta contends that the Cannae Drive creates a bias in the quantum vacuum and pushes against it. Basically, physicists think that at very, very small scales, much smaller than atoms or even protons, space bubbles with quantum fluctuations. This bubbling is represented in the math as sort of imaginary particles that are spawned in pairs, and then very, very quickly the pairs come back together and destroy each other. Fetta contends that the Cannae Drive creates a bias where some of these particles never come back together, and then \"pushes\" against them.\n\n## Cannae Tests So Far\n\nThe only independent (not conducted by the inventor, the inventor's company, or by labs hired by the inventor) tests of the Cannae Drive that I can verify have been done by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center.\n\nThey performed three tests:\n\n1. The device as the inventor designed it.\n2. The device as the inventor designed it *without* the slotting that the inventor claimed was critical. (Called the \"null test\".)\n3. A control test that used the same energy, but without the cavity present in the design.\n\nThe results of these tests were as follows:\n\n1. Approximately 25 micronewtons of thrust at 50 Watts.\n2. The same results as test #1, showing that at the very least, the slotting provided no benefit or detriment to the effect happening.\n3. No measurable thrust.\n\nFor each of these tests they use a torsion pendulum which could measure thrust down to about 10 micronewtons or so. They also ran the test multiple times. In addition, they ran the test in two directions, making sure that the directional thrust changed with the direction of the device (to attempt to eliminate the possibility of noise or instrumentation error). The Cannae Drive passed these test, and the control test showed it was unlikely (although not impossible) to be a heating or air current effect.\n\nThe confusion over the naming of the \"null test\" however led many people to think that NASA reported the same thrust in the control test. This was not the case. The fact that the null test showed only that the inventor's ideas for why thrust was being measured were incomplete or wrong, but it is certain that thrust was measured. That still does not eliminate other factors in measurement or the test setup that might have accounted for the measured thrust, although the control test does make the list smaller.\n\nThe \"null test\" also was only performed on the Cannae Drive, and has no bearing on the EmDrive tests, as the EmDrive has no such features which might have be tested in this way, which has been another point of confusion among many people.\n\n## EmDrive Tests\n\nThe following independent tests have been performed for the EmDrive.\n\n1. A test at 2500 W of power during which a thrust of 750 millinewtons was measured by a Chinese team at the Chinese Northwestern Polytechnical University.\n2. A test at 50 W of power during which a thrust of 50 micronewtons was measured by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center at ~760 Torr of pressure. (Summer 2014)\n3. A test at 50 W of power during which a thrust of 50 micronewtons was measured by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center at ~5.0\u00d710^\u22126 torr or pressure. (Early 2015)\n4. A test at 50 W of power during which an interferometer (a modified Michelson device) was used to measure the stretching and compressing of spacetime within the device, which produced initial results that were consistent with an Alcubierre drive fluctuation.\n\nAll these tests were conducted with a control device that did not produce thrust.\n\n**UPDATED**\n\nNOTE: a better source was found for the Chinese results, and I have changed this section to reflect that.\n\nTest #1 was conducted at the direction of lead researcher Juan Yang. She tested the device at several power levels and frequencies using the same equipment used to test Ion Drives. The given result above was the largest result produced. Her team estimated that the total measurement error was less than 12%. [Source 1](http://www.emdrive.com/yang-juan-paper-2012.pdf) | [Source 2](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/evaluating-nasas-futuristic-em-drive/)\n\nTests number 2 and 3 were performed multiple times, changing direction of the device and observing a corresponding change in the direction of force. They were not especially careful about controlling for ALL variables however, mostly owing to the lack of funding for the project. The positive tests have resulted in more funding becoming available, although it is still very, very little, and possibly not enough to explain where the error occurred if the measurement is error of some kind.\n\nTest #4 was performed, essentially, on a whim by the research team as they were bouncing ideas off each other, and was entirely unexpected. They are extremely hesitant to draw any conclusions based on test #4, although they certainly found it interesting.\n\nThe Eagleworks team has been able to dedicate very little hardware towards this experiment, as there has been almost no dedicated funding for this experiment. The lack of funding is related to how outlandish the claims are to those who understand physics very well, and the lack of adequate explanation on the math behind the devices from the inventors.\n\n## Criticism\n\nMuch criticism has been given to the experiments. Some of it is warranted, but some of it is confusion.\n\nThe idea that the control produced thrust is false, and has been perpetuated due to people interpreting the name \"null test\" to correspond to the control test. Other physicists have attacked the results based on the null test as well, although they have limited the criticism mainly to showing that the explanations provided by the inventor are wrong, not to invalidate the data collected so far.\n\nThere has also been much criticism over not testing in a vacuum, (although they have since tested the device at approximately 5.0x10^-6 torr pressure and achieved identical results), while others have claimed the team did not account for the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nI can't find any definitive accounts that the team accounted for Earth's magnetic field, but many find it hard to believe that they would be putting so much effort into these tests without accounting for something that is so easy to account for.\n\nOthers have criticized the measurement devices, specifically that so little force was measured. While the measured thrust was over 5 times the sensitivity limits of the torsion pendulum, with such small forces it is much easier for some sort of noise or other factor to appear to be thrust. \n\nRelatedly, some have claimed that tests at such small power are useless. The main reason the tests were conducted at such low wattage have to do with the hardware that was available to test with, and Eagleworks is planning on conducting a higher power test sometime this year.\n\nSome have questioned why no companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, or SpaceX have attempted to investigate the device, but regardless of how likely these companies find the results so far, the largest reason is almost surely that the devices are both patented by their inventors.\n\nMost however have criticized the tests based on the fact that there is no explanation for such results, and that they apparently contradict known laws of physics. With no understanding of the mechanism of such a device, the obvious answers seem to violate principles that nearly every other experiment in history have followed. For some, this alone is enough to dismiss the data, regardless of the controls used and the directional results.\n\n## What's Next\n\nFollowing the positive results last year and early this year, Eagleworks have been able to dedicate more and better hardware to the experiment. They plan to conduct the experiment with more controls at higher power this year, and when they are able to achieve results higher than 100 micronewtons for either device, they plan on having the test replicated at the Glenn Research Center, the Jet Propulsion Lab, and John Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.\n\nIf the experiment for either or both devices is replicated at higher power, and again at the other labs, it is likely that the physics community will work very hard to try and invalidate the experiments as there is little explanation for the results. This is good. This is science. You don't do science by proving correct things, you do science by disproving wrong things.\n\nIf either device gets to that stage however, it is likely that someone will start on a test in space very quickly. The applications for a device that functions as these appear to would basically replace every form of transportation and thrust invented by humans to date. Such a device would easily be used to make cars, planes, bikes, boats, etc., all more efficient, clean, and cheap.\n\nThere are many reasons to doubt we will ever be flying to Saturn with one of these things, but it is equally important to talk about science in the context of what we KNOW.\n\nWe KNOW that this experiment is producing results that contradict hundreds of years of other data, although that data was collected under different circumstances with different characteristics.\n\nWe KNOW that thrust is being measured, and that it is beyond the range of \"noise\", and that it is directional according to the device, but we do not know if the cause is thrust actually being generated, or some other factor which makes it appear that way.\n\nWe KNOW that Fetta's explanation for the Cannae Drive did not pass the \"null test\", making it extremely unlikely that his explanation is correct. We also KNOW that Shawyer's explanation for the EmDrive involve physics that won't actually be directly tested with this device, and so even a positive result doesn't necessarily vindicate his explanation.\n\nWe KNOW that it's very likely that the results are spurious, and that is why we are dedicating so few resources to the tests that the team didn't even have vacuum rated capacitors for over six months. But we also KNOW that a positive result, however unlikely, would be a world changing discovery, and so the possible reward is great, while the extremely limited resources we are committing to the project give us little risk.\n\nAnd finally, we KNOW that the teams involved at the moment are well educated, well trained, experienced researchers dedicated to figuring out what is *true*, not what people *wish* was true, and so we should have little reason to criticize the researchers personally for their involvement in such a project.\n\nAll of the stuff we know has come out *without any results being published*, because all the researchers involved, in the US and in China, are committed to doing a thorough job before drawing final conclusions. When you get a peek behind the curtain, science looks incredibly messy, but the result is a better understanding of our Universe, and that's always worth it no matter how these tests pan out.\n\n## If you have changes or updates that can be verified in any way, contact me and I will update this post.\n\n## [Source List](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/34cq1b/the_facts_as_we_currently_know_them_about_the/cqua3ti)",

            "body": "So, to give you a little background me and this guy went on a few dates and he moved far away. We got along well, things didn't get very far. He is really nice, however, I wasn't leaning one way or the other. \n\nHe sent me the Post Secret books for xmas. He hinted at another present, but said I had to wait. It's a little after Christmas, but I got this email yesterday with the title \"I wanted to make something for you for Christmas\":\n\n\"So I told the computer, and it showed me how to write a poem in byte-form.  I can't tell what you're thinking these days, but this will either remind you of something that was good, or send you off.\"\n\n\nIt included a link to a poem.zip file, which I downloaded. Inside, there was a file called magicfile with no extension and a ReadMe that said:\n\n\"Intructions:\n\n 1: > copy magicfile magicfile.jpg\n 2: > copy magicfile magicfile.zip\n ... skip a few ...\n X: Ask it for help\"\n\nWhen I renamed magicfile it turned into a picture of me! (a bad one that he took, but ok) and when I changed magicfile to a .zip inside it contained: Magicfile.exe and a txt called \"Go Ahead\" that said:\n\n\"It's safe.  Requires WPF and .Net 3.5 I think...\n\nWhatever, it works on my machine.\"\n\nI opened magicfile, and an interface popped up that said \"enter a passphrase\". So, I typed in \"help\" and got this:\n\n\"Hi Sara!\n\nAs you are just about figuring out, this is just the very beginning of a very, very large rabbit hole you're about to fall into.\n\nYou see, sometime in early November, I had an idea for an awesome program.  Simultaneously I was just beginning to think of what might be a decent Christmas present for you.  Put 2 and 2 together, and you get this thing.  I worked on it on and off for a few weeks - it was a pretty fun way to learn WPF and do a lot of interesting byte manipulation.\n\nYou see, it's a completely self-contained magical file.  This magical file is three parts:\n 1. If you name it .jpg - it's an image!\n 2. If you name it .zip - it's a zip file, containing a program\n 3. It's a database of many, many more parts that the program reads\n\nNow, when you run the program, it reads the magic file, and asks for a passphrase.\n\nYou're obviously gotten that far, or you wouldn't be reading this.  As you can imagine - there are a bunch of passwords.  Not infinite, but many.  I encourage you to guess at words and try to figure them out.  I'll give you the hints that they would be things relevant to you or to us.\n\nWith a little ingenuity, you'll be able to figure out a very important passphrase that will take you to the next step...\"\n\n\nAs I have gone on and solved some of the mysteries I have found that pictures of me come up, things he's researched, things we did together and so on and so forth. I still am trying to figure out the important passphrase. \n\nReddit, this is the most beautiful gift I have ever gotten and it leaves me in a funny place possibly going on the other side of the world to see what happens here. He is an avid redditor, and though I hate the \"VOTE THIS UP, PLOX\" posts I'd love to get this on the front page to show him what this meant. Thank you. \n\ntl;dr:\n\nA nerd made a beautiful nerd gift for me, it was a program that was a mystery and shows things we did together. Please vote this up to show him how much it meant. \n\n\n\n**EDIT:** A lot of people are saying that the fact that I am unsure about what to do means I don't like him. That is not at all the case, I like him a lot. I really enjoyed spending time with him, he is brilliant (there is nothing I like more than a man that can teach me things), funny, and best of all a great time. \n\nIn order to go see him right now I have to take a 14hr plane flight. Which means I would be staying a week, and I'm not sure I'm quite at that point yet. \n\nDamnit, what do they say? \"Explain the problem out loud to yourself\" Alright, I'm going. There is no reason not to, this WAS awesome. I will let you folks know how it goes. ",

It had a little mark on the shutter, and it took me a few seconds to realize that it was supposed to be hole.  Its been so long since I've seen one it made me wonder how many of you out there have never seen one?  How many of you have ever seen one, but never used one?  How about 5.25\"?  The 8\" ones are before my time.  I've never seen one of those, although I have seen drives for them.  Bonus points if you've seen/used one of those.\n\nNow, to bring it around, how long will it be that floppy disk icons become an abstract representation of the concept \"save.\"  Or are we already there?",

            "body": "***Update***\n\nHere's the whole story: http://www.theweinerworks.com/?p=86\n\n***********\n\nMy sites are down, so perhaps I can reach out through reddit:\n\nDear dude who keeps hacking my sites,\nA lot of people would take this opportunity to rant about hackers being dickheads. I'm not going to do that. It's unproductive, and it fails to recognize the contributions hackers and ex-hackers have made to society. I firmly believe that a strong community of hackers is part of citizens' protection from government encroachment on freedom of speech online.\n\nThat said, let me tell you why  you shouldn't hack my site.\n\nFirst, the professional. Regardless of what you think of me personally (though I don't know if this is whence the maliciousness), SMBC's success helps a lot of people. I have a part time assistant and a business manager who make an important part of their income off my ad revenue. Whenever you knock down the site (or lessen its traffic by loading trojans), you decrease my income, and thereby decrease my ability to pay for these people.\n\nAdditionally, the success of SMBC helps pay for SMBC Theater. SMBC Theater is a project that, on any given weekend, might bring together one or two dozen talented people putting in their spare time for something they love. When you mess with my revenue stream, you also jeopardize that. Again, regardless of how you feel about me or that project, what you're doing poses potential harm to a lot of nice, intelligent, hard working people.\n\nWhenever you knock down my servers, other websites go down as well. This includes Snowflakes, The Weinerworks, and Weinersmith. All of these are sites that I, James, Chris Jones, and Kelly work on without making much of return, and all of them are educational sites. When you down these, the way I see it, it makes the world a teeny tiny little bit worse. \n\nI don't consider myself to have a great amount of influence over the way people behave, but in my short career I have the privilege of helping a lot of young people. I've gotten countless emails from people saying I helped them through depression, inspired them to take on challenges, and encouraged them to stay in difficult academic programs. I don't believe for a second that they did these things BECAUSE of me - nobody does anything hard without putting in the bulk of the effort  personally. But, I do believe SMBC provides a helpful service to a lot of good people, and I'm very lucky to be the conduit for that service. When you down my site (or any of the others), this goes away.\n\nI suspect a lot of the above could be said about many websites, and that's sort of my point. I understand hackers who try to get at sensitive information, or who try to harass jerks. I don't understand what the value is in taking down a site like mine, which provides nothing but jokes and information.\n\nLastly, whenever you hack my site, it causes a lot of anxiety for me, and for everyone who works with me. Right now, because of this latest attack, my brother (who was at work, and who has two lovely kids) had to run home to deal with this problem. In other words - when you attack my site, you're not just attacking some abstract thing on the Internet. You're causing physical distress to a lot of people who don't deserve it.\n\nSo please, please just stop.\n\nThanks,\nZach Weinersmith\n\ntl;dr: When you hack my servers, you distress me and others physically and financially. We're not a black box - we're real people. So we'd all take it very kindly if you'd stop.\n\nPS: Because this is reddit, I want to be clear: I'm not asking for any internet justice. Just sending a message in a bottle, hoping it falls into the right hands.\n\nEDIT: Holy crap! Thanks for all the upvotes and advice. I think we have resolved the problem, and I'll see if I can get Marty (webmaster/brother) to post about it. Thanks nerds!",

It had been out of print for more than a year, but I could never get myself to update it, because it looked like too much work.\n\nRecently, I asked for help in updating it, and a few people volunteered. Thanks to these volunteers, the book is now free to read online (and will remain so). \n\nThe book assumes you already know Python, or any other language. I feel there are too many resources for beginners, and not enough for intermediate/advanced programmers.\n\nAnyway, check it out here:\n\n[http://pythonforengineers.com/python-for-scientists-and-engineers/](http://pythonforengineers.com/python-for-scientists-and-engineers/)\n\nCheers,\nShantnu \n\n\n\n\n",

Its connectivity with everything has allowed me to do all kinds of interesting and fun things. When I discovered that the [AxiDraw](http://www.axidraw.com/) pen plotter has a [Python binding](https://github.com/inconvergent/axidraw-xy), I decided to try writing in my own handwriting with my own pen. Something I've been unable to do for years.\n\nIt has taken a lot, mostly because I can't type, so I've been limited to voice recognition and copy and paste, but the letter linked above is where I got to this evening.\n\nI thought I would share my mini triumph.\n\nI've learned and programmed in a lot of different languages over the years. I have written several languages myself. And even though Python wasn't my first language, it is the first language I consider for any new project. I'd have to have a compelling reason to use something else. So thank you, Python, for making this possible.\n\n</ shameless preaching to the choir> ;)\n\n---\n\nEdit: In the comments a couple of people asked for a video. I will make a proper video with the AxiDraw as soon as I can. [We just did a quick test](https://youtu.be/W5YGwNlO53A) on my wife's Cricut craft cutter. It works there too, though you can't tilt the pen or change the pressure. So apologies it's not the proper plotter, but you can see how the paths are traced on this video.",

Note that if you want to receive updates to the book, you will want to create an account and add the book to your library. \n\nI currently support the following digital formats: **PDF**, **epub** and **mobi** \n\nYou might also want to check out my blog which has lots of fun Python tutorials and links to my other books: http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/\n\n**Update 2016-10-17**: For those of you who like numbers, I thought I'd share a bit of statistics with you. The number of people who used the Leanpub link to download the book hit **18,037** while approx. **6670** people used the Gumroad coupon. I don't have a simple way of checking who used both sites, so assuming that no one did, the total number of new readers is **24,707**!\n\nThat's so awesome! Thanks so much for your interest. I hope you all enjoy the book!",

            "body": "Hey everyone, I'm a C/C++ programmer who recently discovered Python.  My friend told me about PyGame, and I decided to try to write an entire game in it.  I want to tell you the order I did things in, as I think you might find it interesting, and maybe try it yourself some time!\n\n**Background:**\n\nEpikos is an RPG I'd been wanting to make for years, but never really had the time to make.  Python, however, writes really expressive code and can really accelerate dev time.  I feel like I can write code 50X faster in Python than in C++.\n\nSince I have a day job, this had to be a project which I could do after work.  Entire thing took about two years, including making all the assets for the game and all the tools.  Workload was about 2 hours after work each day, and a lot more time on the weekends.\n\n**Step 1:  Making the tools for the game**\n\nFor reference, game screenshots can be seen here:\n\nhttp://www.epikosrpg.com/screenshots/\n\n**The Console:**\n\nFirst, I made what I call a \"console.\"  It's a bit like a DOS or Linux shell.  I wanted this so I could type commands into my game and the toolset used to create the game.  It doesn't look like much, but here is an example of what the console looks like:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/mMutYwL\n\n**The Paint Program:**\n\nNext, the game needed a program to create sprite art in.  I could have used photoshop, aesprite, or any number of paint programs, but I wanted to make my own custom sprite animation tool, and I wanted it in Python.  I had barely done any python coding at this point, but even then the paint tool took only a couple of days to write.  It's called tilemake, and it looks like this:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Qw4BMMc\n\nAs you can see, this paint tool uses the console, which I had built first.  In the above example, I have loaded the \"knight\" sprite, which is used for one of the main characters in the game.  The tool shows you multiple zoomed in versions of the sprite (\"mips\") and you can paint on any one of them, using the CGA color palette.  You can also animate the sprites in this very tool.\n\nI got a lot of milage out of this tool, as the game has 826 sprite frames in it, all made with this very paint program.\n\n**The Map Editor:**\n\nNow, my game needed 2D maps.  Since I had some art made with the paint program, it was time to arrange this art in the form of a map.  The map editor looks like this:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/qLA9vYk\n\nThere are several components to this editor, but keep in mind I'm sticking 100% to Python.  In the main view, you can zoom and scroll about with the mouse, and paint using several different sized brushes.\n\nYou can see a column to the right which says \"natural\".  This shows all the sprites which are used in a natural environment.  There are other categories, such as indoors, dungeon, etc.  Categories were important, since I have many, many different sprites.\n\nFinally, on the bottom you can see our old friend, the console.\n\n**Step 2:  The Game Itself:**\n\nOnce you have the map editor, making a game isn't really that different, it just has gameplay logic.  Most of it is really simple, this includes combat logic, movement, etc.  I'm not going to go into the details of these since writing them in Python should be fairly trivial, but ask me if you want something explained in greater detail.  I will, however, go over some highlights and gotchas:\n\n**AStar (A*):**\n\nA* is a common AI algorithm used for pathing.  Implementing it in Python is pretty easy.  Python reads a lot like pseudocode, and A* can be found on wikipedia:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\n\nThat code isn't really very different from Python is it?  As an excercise, you can try pasting that into Python and see what you need to change.  Hint:  not much.  Shouldn't take you more than half an hour to get some good AI pathing going.\n\n**Save/Load with Pickle:**\n\nI *love* pickle, and used it for save/loading.  It's a standard Python module, so if you haven't used it yet you should check it out.  One gotcha was that saveing and loading maps was too expensive in pickle, so I compressed the maps first with basic dictionary encoding, and then used pickle on them.\n\nWhen writing save/load, make sure to include version filtering or some mechanism so that if you change file formats later on, older files are automatically updated.  You don't want your players to lose progress just because you patched and changed savegame format!\n\n**Font?:**\n\nThere are several legal issues surrounding the use of fonts on a cross-platform title, and I really didn't want to bother with that.  I couldn't find a good free font which matched my art style, so I created my own font for my game.  If you can do this, I recommend it, because then you own it and can use it forever.\n\n**Music:**\n\nOne thing I didn't write from scratch was the music authoring software.  Audio isn't really my expertise, but I wanted NES sounding music.  I ended up using this:\n\nhttp://famitracker.com/\n\nFamitracker is a fun way to write NES-sounding music, and indeed it actually writes to the nes file format.  Of course, PyGame can't play this, so I converted it to .ogg format.  Why .ogg?  I found that other supported formats tended to crash pygame, so I recommend that one.\n\n**Sound FX:**\n\nSimilarly, I wanted an old-school feeling for my sound FX.  Authoring these in famitracker didn't seem that efficient, but someone showed me a tool called bfxr:\n\nhttp://www.bfxr.net/\n\nThis let me create all kinds of sounds for my game.  For more complicated sounds, I needed to fallback to famitracker, but 90% of the sounds were in bfxr.\n\n**Shipping the Game:**\n\nI couldn't ship raw .py files, so I used pyinstaller to turn my game into a single .exe file.  I had tried python2exe, but couldn't get it to work very well with pygame.  Maybe you can have better luck with python2exe, but I'd recommend pyinstaller.  PyInstaller uses another library called setupTools.  For some reason, my .exe wouldn't work with the latest version of setupTools (gave an error and immediately quit), so I had to do this:\n\npip install setuptools==19.2\n\nThat gives you the older version, which should work.\n\nThe last part of shipping is making the .exe and game assets into an installer.  For this I used something called NSIS.  Sadly, I can't recommend you use this at this point, since it was on Sourceforge and if you go there now you'll probably get viruses and malware (RIP Sourceforge).  If you happen to have an older version of NSIS, I recommend backing it up on your google drive, since re-downloading it is not an option.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile there were some gotchas, I didn't have too much trouble making a small-scale game 100% in Python, and it was a suitable project to do after work, even while working a full-time job.  \n\nHappy coding!\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThank you for the Reddit gold.  This has inspired me to share some other misc info with you now:\n\n*  One huge advantage of Python is that porting from Windows to Linux only took an afternoon.  I did it all on virtualbox running Mint.  In fact, setting up virtualbox to run Mint was harder than porting the game.  There were two gotchas.  First, if you're using time.clock() on windows, make sure to change it to time.time() on Linux.  Second, some of the backslashes in filenames needed to be changed to forward slashes.  That's it!!!\n\n*  If you are on Windows, I recommend trying the Python plug-in for Visual Studio.  I didn't actually use it while developing my game, but I think it would have helped from time to time.  It gives breakpoints, variable watch, and callstack info.\n\n\n\n",

All tutorials are free in both text and video forms.\n\nThe latest series that I have put out is [Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/). The aim of this series is to show what can be done with Python in the field of finance and algorithmic trading using data science (spoiler alert: a lot!). \n\nEven though you probably aren\u2019t going to get rich, you might save yourself a lot of money (when you back test your silly trading idea and realize it\u2019s bad), and you\u2019ll learn about statistics and data science with Python along the way. \n\nI start the series off with a simplistic introduction to using Python+[Pandas](https://pythonprogramming.net/data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial-introduction/)+[Matplotlib](https://pythonprogramming.net/matplotlib-intro-tutorial/)  to get stock data, visualize stock data, and to manipulate this data. \n\nFrom here, we get into Quantopian, which is a Python-based platform built on top of the Zipline library for back-testing, but has since expanded out to enable quite a bit more than that.\n\nWe use Quantopian both for simplistic back testing, but also for doing research into future trading strategies, since Quantopian also provides a bunch of free data like minute pricing data, fundamentals along with tools like [Alphalens](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens) for analyzing various factors that you believe to be beneficial to a trading strategy.\n\nIf you would like to check it out, the series starts here: \n[Python for Finance introduction](https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/)\n\nIf you are already familiar with Pandas and want to jump straight into the strategies and using Quantopian for back-testing and research:\n[Algorithmic trading and research with Quantopian](https://pythonprogramming.net/quantopian-trading-strategies-introduction-python-programming-for-finance/)\n\nIf you have any questions, requests, or suggestions, feel free to ask here or on the respective tutorials.",

The author could have done better imo.\n\n1. [Pillow](http://python-pillow.org/) -- Image processing\n1. [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) -- add a GUI interface to your python CLI programs\n1. [Peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee) -- a small, expressive ORM for mySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite\n1. [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) -- a web scraping framework\n1. [Apache Libcloud](http://libcloud.apache.org/) -- A single API wrapper to many cloud providers (like linode, rackspace, etc.)\n1. [Pygame](http://pygame.org/lofi.html) -- make multimedia programs, like games.\n1. [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) -- useful for scientific computing. If you use this, you should also check out SciPy and Pandas.\n1. [Sh](https://github.com/amoffat/sh) -- call shell sub-processes as if they were functions.\n1. [Python-docx](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx) -- process/create MS Word documents. (I also recommend checking out openpyxl for Excel docs)\n1. [PyFilesystem](https://github.com/PyFilesystem/pyfilesystem2) -- abstract your entire filesystem similar to the way a file object abstracts a single file.\n1. [EbookLib](https://github.com/aerkalov/ebooklib/) -- process EPUB2/EPUB3 ebook formats. Kindle format under development per github page.\n1. [Cython](http://cython.org/) -- write C extensions for python.\n1. [Behold](https://github.com/robdmc/behold) -- debugging tool\n\nProps to /u/COAST_TO_RED_LIGHTS\n\nEdit:\nPlease stop upvoting this.

While it is intended for beginners, some have claimed that they needed more hand-holding than this book provided for them. So I currently recommend it as an introductory and intermediate book for developers that are looking to learn Python.\n\nWhen I originally wrote the book, I noticed that there were few or no books available that described how to create executables of your code or distribute your code via Python\u2019s Package Index (PyPI). Python 101 covers these topics as well as introducing the reader to Python\u2019s standard library, how to install 3rd party packages and an introduction to some of the most popular 3rd party packages for Python, such as SQLAlchemy, requests and virtualenv.\n\nPython 101 has **5 sections, 44 chapters and 295 pages**.\n\nYou can get Python 101 for free on Leanpub using the following link: http://leanpub.com/python_101/c/48hours\n\nIf you happen to have a [Gumroad](https://gum.co/bppWr) account, then you\u2019ll be able to get the book free there as well by using the following offer code: **48hours**\n\nYou will get the **PDF**, **epub** and **mobi** versions of the book. You can see a full table of contents on the Leanpub site\n\nIf you like my first book, you can get its sequel, **Python 201: Intermediate Python** for **50%** off here: http://leanpub.com/python201/c/50percent\n\nI also write a fun [Python blog](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/) that has many other tutorials on it.",

If the above code doesn't work, use this one instead: https://www.udemy.com/automate/?couponCode=RESOLVE_TO_CODE2_2016\n\nThis discount code will work until New Year's Day and give you lifetime access, so you can sign up now and take the course later when you have free time. The course follows my book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, which is also [free to read online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) under a Creative Commons license.\n\nThe course covers the same material in the book, which is aimed at total beginners. The material is especially those who don't necessarily want to become software developers but want to automate computer tasks with simple scripts: updating Excel spreadsheets, reading PDFs, web scraping, etc. It's also nice for experienced developers who want to learn about some really practical Python modules.\n\n(Side note for those reading this post after New Year's Day: The last time I posted a free code, I still gave out free codes to people who messaged me after the deadline. But I'm going to have to tighten down on that this time around. You can always use the code HALF_OFF to bring the price from $60 to $30: https://www.udemy.com/automate/?couponCode=HALF_OFF )",

Added argparse to instruct the user better. Added tests. Fixed several broken commands. Thanks guys!",

            "body": "(Sorry for the throwaway, but I wanted to be able to answer questions honestly without any hesitation.)\n\nI've been in IT since I was 17 in 1999. I started off at a help desk, and worked my way up to a Systems Administrator where I was making 60k USD/yr. (I currently have only an associates degree with no plans to go back to school.) I was primarily a Windows domain/ network admin, with a few *nix boxes spread throughout. I had known windows batch scripting, and way back in the day had programmed in BASIC before the world was.\n\n\nI had tossed around the idea of learning a programming language before, but when asked I'd often say \"Developers' brains just work differently than mine. I'm not a coder.\" Programming seemed so abstract and I couldn't really wrap my head around it.  I finally decided though, to try something.\n\nIt was 2010 and I had heard a lot of Ruby on Rails and thought that Ruby would be a great language to learn. I ran through the tutorial of making a polls app at least 5 times, but I just couldn't wrap my head around it. So I gave up.\n\n\nOne year later I heard about python. Despite all the negative talk about python while googling for \"python vs ruby vs php vs ...\" *(GIL, speed, whitespace, duck typing, (not that I knew what ANY of that meant anyway))* I decided that I really wanted to give it a shot. I started out with codeacademy to get my feet wet, I'd tinker with idle while my wife and I would watch netflix after the kids went to bed. Then I started dreaming in code.\n\nHave you ever had \"work dreams\"? The kind you have for about 2 weeks after starting a new job that's really hard? That was python for me. Being primarily in a Windows environment it was hard to find anything for python to do initially at work. My boss didn't program, and really didn't see the value in it. Then one day I found myself needing to compare a list of files. I needed to find all the files that were in one column but not in the other. I had them in excel and after working through a formula I had my answer, but I hated it. All I wanted to do was write something like--\n\n    select name from column1 where name not in (select name from column2);\n    \nEnter python and sqlite. It probably took me about 3 hours to figure it out, but I imported a csv into a sqlite table in python so I could query it. BAM! I was hooked from then on.\n\nEvery night I would tinker, read, and play. I found tons of things to automate at work, making my time so much more effective. I loved it. I became a python evangelist. I'd like to say that my boss was impressed, but really he never came around, and it frustrated me. Fast forward a year.\n\nI had heard about the DevOps movement and though I didn't understand it completely at the time I thought that being a Developer and Systems Admin mutant sounded like a lot of fun, and something I could really be good at. \n\nAfter having a rough time with my boss one day I decided to check the local classifieds. I saw an ad for a DevOps Admin. Basically this guy needed to know hardware, networking, provisioning, something called puppet, and one of three scripting languages- ruby, bash, or python. \n\nI looked at puppet, and after having learned about booleans and strings and syntax from python, picking it up wasn't a problem. I got hired on the spot for $90k USD. A clean 50% raise. I use python every single day. I write scripts to check if databases back up properly, if services are up, if all 1000 of my physical servers are getting their updates, to provision RAIDs, you name it. I integrate what I write into puppet, fabric, and a host of other tools that I've learned along the way.\n\nAfter doing that for a little over a year now, I'm about to hire 2 guys under me as we expand and I'm moving up to $120k USD. I'm learning django for fun and am just starting into machine learning. I check out /r/python every day, you guys have been so helpful to me along my way. And if I can learn python, anybody can!!!\n\nTL;DR\nI learned python in a year and got a 50% raise. 1 year later I got another 25% raise, all from python!\n\nedit: percentages, oh math...\n\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "Hello, long time lurker of this sub. I've been wanting to learn python for a long time because I've been making computer graphics with blender 3D for over 10 years. \n\n\nSo a little over a year ago I decided to start teaching myself. I started with codeacadamy's python course and then worked on several small personal projects. Such as automating some stuff at work. I then did [Udacitys Intro To Programming Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000) I overall feel pretty confident with python now, but it's hard to gauge how good you are at something if you don't reference it with other people. So here I am to share!\n\n\n\nSo I currently work as what is probably best described as a \"security guard supervisor\" all though it is a lot more than that. I work at a charity with a low income housing complex in which all guests or staff are required to sign in and out of the building. This is necessary because of certain laws requiring it with charities(it's complicated).  And also so roll calls can be done with the staff if there is a fire alarm.\n\n\nBefore they simply had a binder with a pen and paper to sign in and out. I asked around and found out that we could print barcodes easily on to our ID cards. So I figured the entire process is pretty low hanging fruit for automation. So I presented my idea to my manager and then later some directors and they approved, since it was practically a free solution, aside from my time on the clock. \n\n\nI did a back of the envelope calculation and determined this program would save about 400+ man hours a year. \n\n\n**TL;DR:** So long story short even though I'm a technically a security guard they let me write python and implement this new system. Which I've had a bunch of staff thank me for because the old way was a a lot more of a pain in the ass.\n\n[Here is the program I wrote.](https://github.com/JosiahSwaim/Punch-IN-OUT) \n\nI want to pursue programming as a career now so any advice is appreciated too.",

            "body": "Hi guys! After a lot of hard-work and sheer determination I have mostly completed my book, \"Intermediate Python\". It will receive updates over time :)\n\nIt has a couple of issues related to grammar and technical info in it. I am working on ironing them out one by one.\n\nI was a bit lazy so didn't upload it earlier but here it is now.\n\nI have decided to distribute it for free! I wanted to give back to this awesome community so this is what I have to offer for now. I am sure that it would help those who really want to be helped. Best of luck! \n\nHere are the links:\n\n- [Html](http://book.pythontips.com)\n- [PDF](http://readthedocs.org/projects/intermediatepythongithubio/downloads/pdf/latest/)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/IntermediatePython/intermediatePython)\n\nIf you like this book then a simple [tweet](https://twitter.com/yasoobkhalid) and a personal email <yasoob DOT khld AT gmail DOT com> would mean a lot to me!\n\nP.S: The book is open-source so if you find typo or technical error or just want to expand it's contents with your own knowledge then just send over a pull request :) Moreover, if you want to give me any tip then kindly pm me your email and I would let you know once I setup a tip-collection system.\n\n**Note:** This is not related with that **paid** \"intermediate Python\" book in any way. I became aware of it today. I had been using this name internally for a couple of months. If the author of **paid** \"Intermediate Python\" has any issue with this I would be more than happy to change the name of my book because he definitely beated me to the finish line. :) \n\n------------------------\n\n**Edit:**\n\nHey guys! All those of you who are going to use this book can really help me and motivate me by letting me know how this book supplements your day to day learning and if you are a Teacher, Assistant Professor or something of that sort then kindly let me know if you would be willing to offer this book to your students or not. :)\n\nYou already have my email address or if you want to tweet about it then you can do so at [@yasoobkhalid](https://twitter.com/yasoobkhalid).\n\nMoreover, I really can't thank this community enough. This community has helped me a LOT over the years. If you see my Reddit profile then you can easily guess that this is the only community (/r/python) where I spend most of my time.\n\n------------------------\n\n####Edit:\n\nYou guys can donate me if you want to by buying the donation version of Intermediate Python from [@gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/intermediate_python) :)\n\n It is only for $10 but if you want to pay less then kindly let me know (pm) and I can give you a custom link.\n\nCheers!",

            "body": "Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com/sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex). \n\nI do my best to produce tutorials for beginner-intermediate programmers, mainly by making sure nothing is left to abstraction and hand waving. \n\nThe most recent series is an in-depth machine learning course, aimed at breaking down the complex ML concepts that are typically just \"done for you\" in a hand-wavy fashion with packages and modules. \n\nThe machine learning series is aimed at just about anyone with a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn. If you're confused about something we're doing, I can either help, or point you towards a tutorial that I've done already (I have about 1,000) to help.\n\nThe main structure for the course is to:\n\n* Do a quick overview of the theory of each machine learning algorithm we cover.\n* Show an application of that algorithm using a module, like scikit-learn, along with some real world data.\n* Break down the algorithm and re-write it ourselves, **without machine learning modules**, in Python.\n\nWe're not rewriting the algorithms with the intention that we're going to actually produce something superior than what's available, but rather to learn more about how the algorithms actually work, so that we understand them better. I also see a lot of people are very keen to learn about deep-learning, but the learning curve to get to that point is quite challenging, since quite a bit of deep learning requires you to have a wholistic understanding of how things are actually working, and not just a high-level understanding of how to use a module. Hopefully this can help. \n\nAt least for me personally, I have learned a lot by breaking the algorithms down, so I thought I would share that in my tutorials.\n\nAll tutorials are posted on **[PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)** as well as **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)**, so you can follow along in video, text, or both forms, and the content is all free. \n\nWe've done linear regression and K Nearest Neighbors so far, and have quite a long way to go still. We are going to be diving into the Support Vector Machine next, then clustering, neural networks and deep learning. Once we've made our way to deep learning, we're going to be working with TensorFlow.\n\nIf all that sounds interesting to you, come hang out and learn with us! \n\nI tend to release a couple videos a week. If you have suggestions/requests, feel free to share. \n\nFollow along with the text/video tutorials: on **[PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)** or **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)** ",

It was my first major project, and you guys gave me alot of tips and comments on what you liked, how I could improve, and the right way to do some open source stuff that I hadn't previously encountered.\n\nAfter **a lot** of rewrites, extensive work (by both me, and the W.I.L.L community), I'm happy to present W.I.L.L version 3.0.\n\n**What can W.I.L.L do?**\n\nOne of my major goals with W.I.L.L was not only to make a cool concept for a personal assistant, but to make it usable and useful. W.I.L.L. already has a number of useful plugins, and it's super easy to add more. \n\n**Plugins W.I.L.L already has:**\n\n* News: ex: \"read me the news\" - a summary of the news from a site of your choice, refreshed every twelve hours\n* Weather: ex: \"What's the weather like?\" - weather for your location, delivered using PyOwm\n* Spotify: ex: \"Play jukebox hero on spotify\" - Searches spotify and opens a spotify url for the song that's found. On android, will open in the spotify app\n* Netflix: ex: \"Watch Futurama on netflix\" - searches netflix and opens a netflix url for the shwo that's found. On android, will open in the netflix app\n* Reminders: ex: \"Remind me in 10 minutes about how awesome W.I.L.L is\" - sets reminders. You can currently be notified via email and socket.io push notifications on the web app, and thanks to the expandable notification framework, it's easy to add new methods of notifying the user.\n* **Search**: The crown jewel of the plugins, set to run by default when no other plugin is triggered by the input. Search runs through a chain of different search engines and sites to find the correct answer of a question. It first searches wolframalpha and wikipedia, and if it can't find anything it uses nlp from the newspaper module and bs4 to parse a correct answer from the top google result.\n\n**Just how easy is it to add a plugin?**\n\n    from core.plugin_handler import subscribe\n    def run_check(event):\n        #Check for a word in the provided spacy nlp object\n        return \"example\" in [i.orth_ for i in event[\"doc\"]]\n    \n    @subscribe({\"name\":\"example\", \"check\": run_check})\n    def example_plugin(event):\n        return {\"type\": \"success\", \"text\": \"example\", \"data\":{}}\n    \n\nThat's it.\n\n**Contact me**\nIf you have any requests for new plugins, or further comments about W.I.L.L, feel free to email me at will@willbeddow.com or leave an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/ironman5366/W.I.L.L)\n\nW.I.L.L is very much still in development and I could use suggestions and advice\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edit**: I forgot about the API! W.I.L.L also provides a free JSON API to use it's features, easily allowing new clients to be written for any platform. It's currently lightly documented in the README, with an example in the quickstart. More extensive documentation is coming as soon as I figure out how I want to write it!\n",

Or in Egypt when the government turned off the internet and started killing all the protestors. That's what this is for.",

After my [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3hbb46/i_just_released_alpha_version_of_intermediate/) post the book received a lot of patches and it is in a whole lot better shape now. It also received a LOT of positive response from the community. It remained on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10075078) and /r/Python. It is currently a [trending](https://github.com/trending?l=python) project on [GitHub](https://github.com/yasoob/intermediatePython) under the Python tab. I am happy to say that it has entered beta stage now. This is the best time to take a look if you haven't already.\n\nMoreover, if you want to add anything to the book or just want to polish it further then you are more than welcome to submit a Pull request on GitHub.\n\nI just wanted to write a quick note that a lot of people asked me last time whether I accept donations. I wasn't accepting donations untill recently. I have uploaded the latest build of the book on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/intermediate_python) so if you feel like tipping me then you can buy the donation version of the book from [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/intermediate_python). It would mean a lot to me and would help me to continue writing free quality content.\n\n**Links:**\n\n- [HTML](http://book.pythontips.com)\n- [EPUB](http://readthedocs.org/projects/intermediatepythongithubio/downloads/epub/latest/)\n- [PDF](http://readthedocs.org/projects/intermediatepythongithubio/downloads/pdf/latest/)\n- [Donate](https://gumroad.com/l/intermediate_python)\n- [Blog](http://pythontips.com)",

One of the comments says\n> Objective-C / Swift live on Apple island, C# lives on Microsoft island. That leaves going back to C++ or surrender oneself to the Python version schizophrenia (sounds most fun of all other options).\n\nI started learning code with Python and I love it. I write it for fun. Now I'm having to learn Java for college and it sucks. There's so much more code to write to do simple things and you can make so many silly little syntax mistakes so easily that it makes it harder to actuallly write functioning code. A lot of people in my class are completely new to programming and they are so lost. \n\nI understand that because of the JVM, Java is super duper portable and a lot of existing code is written in Java. Is that the only reason it continues to be used? Would a startup or a company building something from the ground up completly avoid Java? Is Java the only language we can use for Android dev?\n\nC++ seems to be universally hated on with C# being the best alternative but leaving you tied to a MS plaform. \n\nThen behind all of this there's Python. Python is a dream to read and write. Has a bunch of amazing libraries to do all kinds of cool shit. There's tools like Flask, Django, Kivy and others that allow you to use Python for WebDev and Mobile Dev. \n\nEven if you look at this sub there are 111,085 readers. /r/Java has 46,788 readers and /r/cpp and /r/csharp have around 30k readers. If everyone loves Python so much why is it not being used more? What am I missing here?\n\n**EDIT:** Too many responses to reply to but thanks everyone for your input. Some good points were made about how I'm srill very new to this and will see the benefit of Java's constraints when working with other devs. Also the fact that Python just cant compete for speed in some situations. \n\nIt seems to me that Python is an excellent tool to have on your utilitiy belt. Great for automating things and supplementing other tools (As well as being perfectly capable, most of the time, of building full size projects). However those other languages might not be that scary and have their own advantages over Python.\n\nIn my opinion though Python is an amazing educational tool. I think it could reasonable be introduced in Primary education without too much hassle while I wouldn;t say the same about Java. \n",

Gone are the horrible days of having to meticulously define and add language-specific formats (Visual Basic makes me physically hurt sometimes).  You can even just straight-up make a list with multiple primitive types...and you don't have to write and import 3-4 different lines of code to do it.  \n\nI know that posts like this aren't particularly interesting, but holy fuck, Python is just so cool that I can't help myself.  I feel like learning Python is as an ephiphany; it's just so efficient and effective.  \n\nIt's a shame that universities and other educational systems are so slow to embrace Python as well: from database administrators to a former executive of Sun Microsystems (Bill Raduchel), businesses want people that know Python.

In addition to that it also finds the median of the job you are looking for and compares it with other jobs that you may be interested in.\n\nRequirements:\n\nyou will need a plotly account with the user name and api_key given once registered.\n\nyou wil also need to download both income and scraps.py and save them in one folder or just download the whole repo.\n\n**Running the code**\n\nyou will need the beautiful soup package, pandas and plotly package. I believe everything else comes natively but i will include a requirements.txt file in the git repo.\n\n[**code**](https://github.com/basalamader/Job-Parser). \n\nOnce you have the script downloaded just format the main() at the bottom and add the list of jobs that you need to check for. Currently the default would be main([\"python analyst\", \"civil engineer\", \"python\"]). The state variable right before the for loop in the main module is currently \"CA\" but you can add your state.\n\nExpected output:\nyou will get output like \n\n* [output0](\"http://i.imgur.com/cGg8ajy.png\")\n* [output1](\"http://i.imgur.com/UsPYZFJ.png\")\n\nit will be  a nice formatted pandas DataFrame that shows the jobs that you selected and top ten jobs displayed on the website.  Then the different levels of income with the mean and the median of every job salary.\n\nIt will also output the graph of the total number of jobs available in the list and the Quantity of jobs available (x) vs salary(y)\n\n**Next part of the development**\n\nI plan to parse the top 15 jobs looking for key words that can be used to buff(SEO) up your resume. In addition to this i also plan to add dice.com in the results and give the user a chance to choose between the two. I really hope you enjoy this and hopefully are able to have much better luck than I am having getting in the job market.\n\nEdit : happy new year!! Pythonistas",

            "body": "I'm working on a solo project so I'm accountable to nobody. The project is just for fun so I have no financial gains from it. I license it as open source and it's available on github just for people to discover it, but I have 0 watchers and I don't ever expect to get any pull requests or anything. It's just on GitHub so I can use Jenkins CI. It's 100% my own thing and it's just for fun.\n\nI keep doing this thing where I'll implement the functionality, then before I finish or I finish the bare minimum and I try to think about how I refactor the code to work better/to future proof it. I've been doing this over and over and over. Sometimes i implement new things, but lost of the time I'm unhappy with my code and I refactor everything.\n\nI come from a non OOP background so my first \"release\" of my project was 100% functional, no classes at all. Then I watched some videos on better Python and I thought \"yeah ok, these 7 functions all use the same interface: let me just write a Class for it as an interface and subclass all 7 functions.\"\n\nThen I watched the \"stop writing classes\" video and thought \"oh ok, yeah these 7 classes all only do __init__ and \"evaluate\"\" which is what the video says is bad class design. I liked the idea of a common shared interface though so I refactored and gave the class more functionality.\n\nThen I realized the class was too busy, and it did things that didn't really make sense for the class. So then comes more refactoring: splitting classes etc.\n\nThen I realized that classes aren't \"things\" but are rather \"data\", and that methods aren't \"class functions\" (noice the space), but are rather functions that act on that data (and a class **is** data). This kind of clicked and made sense, so inrefactored again.\n\nNow all my classes are logically \"data\" objects instead of \"thing\" objects, and I have methods that act on the data and nothing more. But the problem is this left me with some functions that didn't really belong to a class, but I thought everything needed to be a class, so I refactored AGAIN and tried to fit those functions in somehow. This meant I had to change some of my \"data classes\" so that it made sense that they owned some of these new methods.\n\nLong story short now I'm looking at my code, and remember this is all just for fun, and I'm seeing a lot of overhead. All these classes, these dependencies, etc, are all overhead when what I really need is a script to call functions. Which is what I had at the beginnig.\n\nAt this point I forked my repo and refactored AGAIN into a simple script with functions.\n\nBut I'm still not happy because now I have a ton of duplicated functions in various scripts/routines. I could refactor yet again and have a \"library\" but then I realize that these scripts can be generalized. You can see where I'm going ...\n\n\nHow do I stop wasting time like this?",

Huge Python fan here, and coincidentally a lawyer. \n\nPython has hugely helped me out with all areas of my legal practice, and as a result, I'm one of the most efficient lawyers I know. (And that's only with some 1000 hours  of study/reading/experimentation/practical use; and I'd love to spend more hours with Python still to deeply understand every inch of its nook and cranny.)\n\nAt this point I've definitely gone beyond the basics: i.e. I have comfort with some of Python's more 'advanced' functions already (e.g. decorators, generators, etc); I've gone through or am going through most of the 'proper' Python books (e.g. Fluent Python, Beazley's Python Cookbook, etc); and I've dabbled with many areas in Python (save for the ultra-specialized ones, like machine learning, which I'm keen on taking on in time). \n\nPython is an amazing tool for me. \n\nAnd having read about this for a bit, I now realize that having another tool under my belt to complement Python would be great. And I may have some time on my plate for that one -- just _one_ -- more tool. (It's not that I don't appreciate the beauty of the many different programming languages, but I have to be realistic with the little time that I have.)\n\nMy question, therefore: Python is a great Swiss knife for all my main tasks, but if there was one other practical language you would recommend that I focus on and learn in depth and which could be useful for a non-programmer/lawyer, what would it be, and why?\n\nAppreciate the tips guys, thank you.",

Love the power the libraries like pickle,soup, smtp etc provide ! \n\nI would have taken a considerable amount of time and coding to build any basic useful thing with C , and would cringe everytime I need to implement a map,list etc ! BTW I do know the usecases of C are very different but the freedom python provides just leaves me wide eyed!\n\nOnly thing is I know very little of how and why python works the way it works . Am currently going thru more usage based tutorials and googling the rest , but unlike C I have a very slight discomfort of the lvl of abstraction . \n\nAny good resources for taking my knowledge to the next level and some good projects to take up next?",

I started the project as I'm a freelance Python developer and only work remotely, and thought it would be nice if there's a site that only lists remote Python jobs as that would save people time from having to check/subscribe to multiple sites.\n\nRight now, I'm doing the job postings manually.  I have a list of sites that I check daily. I make sure that the job actually involves Python before posting it as sometimes you'll see postings like \"we're a Java shop, but we'd also consider candidates who have experience in Python, etc.\", and they get tagged as \"python\" because it appeared in the text.\n\nI hope some of you will find the site useful and any feedback is appreciated!",

I really enjoy listening to these podcasts when I\u2019m at the gym or driving. \n\nThere are some great podcasts about Python development out there but I just couldn\u2019t find a good and up-to-date list.\n\nMy (arbitrary) criteria for inclusion on this list are:\n\n* episode download links must work; and\n* the podcast must be active (new episodes are coming out) OR at least have an interesting archive with old episodes worth listening to.\n\nI plan to keep this list updated, so feel free to shoot me a PM if you think anything is missing or if you\u2019d like to see your own Python podcast added :)\n\nThanks!",

At a later date I'll probably recode it to actually use a tilemap instead of my weird idea of using a background and stretching to fit an arbitrary aspect ratio. There are a few really minor features I didn't feel like adding, mostly because I'm tired of working on this project for two straight months.\n\nTo be honest, if I'd known how much work it would be to recreate Super Mario Bros, I'd have chosen a different project.  I always assumed Mario was a pretty simple game, but it's actually quite complicated. Adding powerups, enemies, updated overhead information, music and sound effects, not to mention the physics of Mario and his animations, made it quite challenging.  I hope you like it!\n\nHere's the repo. Controls are arrow keys, 'a' for jump, 's' for run/fireball.  You'll need to install [pygame](http://http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).  \n\nhttps://github.com/justinmeister/Mario-Level-1\n\nEDIT:\nThanks for all the kind words. You guys are great. I know this isn't /r/learnpython, but for anyone interested in getting into pygame, here are the resources I used to learn:\n\n[Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com)\n\n[Program Arcade Games with Python and Pygame](http://programarcadegames.com)\n\n[Mekire's github](https://github.com/Mekire)\n\n[Mario and the state pattern](http://paarsgames.nl/2013/07/29/animate-mario-using-pygame/)\n\n[The State Pattern](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html)\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nFor those with problems getting pygame to work, here are some tips from the comments:\n\n[If there is an 'unrecognized music format'](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ymn1w/i_recreated_the_first_level_of_super_mario_bros/cfm09hs)\n\n[If 'no module named pygame'](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ymn1w/i_recreated_the_first_level_of_super_mario_bros/cflys9n)\n\n[If you want to change the keybindings](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ymn1w/i_recreated_the_first_level_of_super_mario_bros/cfm5nzr)\n\n[If you're unsure how to navigate github to get the game going](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ymn1w/i_recreated_the_first_level_of_super_mario_bros/cflvwxe)\n\nEDIT 3: Heh, someone posted this at [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7284062).

There's not really much to say beyond that - they don't magically do things that .format() doesn't. But once you start using them, you get hooked. It just feels so surprisingly natural, you wonder why you ever did it any other way. If you don't believe me, just try it! \n\nKudos too to PyCharm for the syntax highlighting and autocompletion support - hope every editor picks up support soon (Jupyter notebooks, I'm looking at you!).",

(easy, but not that easy, I'm not sure if I can answer this clearly)\n* Do you know what list and dict comprehensions are? Can you give an example? \n*  Show me three different ways of fetching every third item in the list\n* Do you know what is the difference between lists and tuples? Can you give me an example for their usage? \n* Do you know the difference between range and xrange? \n* Tell me a few differences between Python 2.x and 3.x?\n* The with statement and its usage.\n* How to avoid cyclical imports without having to resort to imports in functions?\n* what's wrong with import all?\n* Why is the GIL important? (This actually puzzles me, don't know the answer)\n* What are \"special\" methods (__<foo>__), how they work, etc\n* can you manipulate functions as first-class objects? \n* the difference between \"class Foo\" and \"class Foo(object)\"\n\n**tricky, smart ones**\n\n* how to read a 8GB file in python?\n* what don't you like about Python?\n* can you convert ascii characters to an integer without using built in methods like string.atoi or int()? [curious one](http://sontek.net/blog/detail/convert-a-string-to-an-integer-in-python)\n\n**subjective ones**\n\n* do you use tabs or spaces, which ones are better?\n\nOk, so should I add something else or is the list comprehensive?",

I suffer from post-Python dissatisfaction syndrome, that is, any other programming language seems just not as expressive, as powerful, and as beautiful as Python. I abstain from mentioning any names to start a flame war, but with many languages that I considered, popular-and-hype or old-and-traditional, that was how I felt.\n\nI wanted to ask you if that's also the case for you, **and** whether you can give me some suggestions for a different programming language. I'm looking for a preferably (AOT) compiled language, although my chief concern is execution speed and the expressiveness of Python. Also, a mature or at least good enough ecosystem of libraries is equally important (for GUI at least).\n\nI asked here because I wanted to hear Pythonistas' preferences for another Pythonic language, sorry if it's considered out-of-place. Feel free to contribute your own opinion on any other language that you consider to be Pythonic.\n\nThanks!",

            "body": "If you're using Flask or Werkzeug (independently of if you're planning on upgrading to Python 3) some help is wanted in making sure that the current versions in the git repositories don't break your code (too much).\n\nThere were some unfortunate API changes necessary due to the restricted bytes type on Python 3 which might show up:\n\n- Werkzeug's `Headers.linked`was removed without replacement.  The API just does not work without string coercion.\n- Werkzeug and Flask `Headers` now returns unicode objects all the time and headers are restricted to latin1.  This is the only thing that makes sense on PEP 3333\n- `werkzeug.urls` is now rewritten from scratch without the stdlib and provides URL parsing and joining functions.  Use those instead of the stdlib one if you want code that works on 2.x and 3.x.  They are internally uniforming IRIs and URIs (or at least attempt).\n- Some deprecated functionality was removed in Werkzeug and Flask.\n- Flask's JSON support differs from the stdlib in unicode behavior on Python 3.  Use `flask.json` instead of `json` or `simplejson` on Python 3 to get unified behavior on 2.x and 3.x regardless of if the stdlib's JSON or simplejson module is used.\n- non-silent usage of limited streams in Werkzeug is gone.  I suppose nobody used that anyways.\n- Werkzeug's request objects now act as context managers and provide a close method.  This ensures that request resources are properly closed without the help of the garbage collector.\n- Fixed some issues with the request object sometimes ignoring the `direct_passthrough` flag.  This might show some errors in your code now.\n- Flask's teardown system got reworked due to exception handling changes on Python 3.  This might now have a knock-on effect if you have custom error handlers.  You might now get an error passed to teardown functions which were previously already hidden.  This change is probably for the better due to teardown handlers being used for resource management.\n\nTo see if your app works with the changes check out the master branches from github and install them into a virtualenv.\n\nRepositories:\n\n    https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask.git\n    https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug.git\n\nThanks :)",

            "body": " Fellow Scientists, what is your workflow in python?\n\nI am a scientist/mathematician first and programmer second.\n\nWriting code for scientific and algorithmic purposes involves looking at some data, writing something that uses said data, run some algorithms, plot the results, writing some more code that uses the data differently because you understood something from the plot.\nRewriting new and ad-hoc algorithms and when you finely like something, you put it in some special file you keep all the other functions that are useful.\n\nThis story, more or less, is what most or the scientists are facing, be it with Matlab, R, Python, or something else.\n\nI have been using python for quite a while now and I like it, but my workflow always seemed a bit suboptimal.\n\nThis is what it looks right now:\nAt any given moment I have 3 windows open:\n\n1) An IPython notebook (called Jupyter notebook now)\n\n2) A IPython qtconsole with the same python as the notebook (this is just an ipython shell)\n\n3) A full IDE for writing the eventual bits of code I like (PyCharm in my case)\n\nThe notebook and qtconsole are side by side. (you can lunch a qtconsole with the same kernel as the notebook with the magic command %qtconsole )\nThe IDE is on the second monitor.\n\nI use the notebook to write small bits of code.\nThe problem with the notebook that you often need to write very small bits of code like this:\n\n    len(arr)\n\nputting these small fractions of code in the notebook just clutters the notebook thus making it too big to find anything.\nIn these cases I use the qtconsole (remember, it is connected to the same python kernel so anything you do in the notebook you can also access in the qtconsole)\n\nTo write big functions or classes I use pycharm and do\n\n    %run /path/to/script/in/pycharm\n\nto run it in the notebook.\n\nAll this is very convoluted, the notebook itself while super nice, isn't very configurable, for example I like much more the cell idea in matlab, where you can run cells and the output is in the shell.\n\nWhat I tested and didn't like at the end:\n1) Spyder - this is the obvious candidate, but it has one major flow, the auto-complete in the the editor is not connected to the python kernel, so even something like this has no autocomplete (in the editor)\n\n    from numpy import *\n    a = zeros(10)\n    a.<tab>            # this would get autocompleted in the notebook but not in spyder\n\n2) using the Pycharm built in notebook support - it is just super buggy at the moment (and has the same problem as spyder)\n\n3)  sublime with sublimeREPL - this is not even close to the notebook capabilities.\n\n4) JupyterLab - this is in alpha and buggy now\n\n5) IEP - has all the features, but it just supper buggy\n\nMy ideal program  will have a good shell support and good cell execution support\n\nSo, what is YOUR workflow?, maybe we will learn from each other!",

I put together a simple readme on the github page.\n\nGithub link: https://github.com/tdietert/youtubePlaylistDL/tree/master\n\nNote: This script does not convert mp4 files to mp3, and downloads the videos at the highest quality available. To make python convert the mp4 into mp3 is a bit more involved, and requires external program I do not wish to mess with at the moment. This is a great area for improvement, if you'd like a small beginner project to work on. Also, you could edit the script so the user could specify their preferred quality, or video format, etc.",

Then, however, without any mention of why, GTA V was completely removed from Universe with no glimmer of hope for it to be back again. I was unhappy for a while, and then took it upon myself to do it myself. I wasn't positive where it would go, and still am not, but I knew we could at least read in game frames and surely send input somehow, and that was enough to at least give it a go.\n\nUsing Python with mainly OpenCV so far, I've created a tutorial series of my experience getting Python to play Grand Theft Auto 5, with the main first project being to create a self-driving car.\n\nThis first batch of tutorials ends with us having a VERY crude self-driving scooter using very rudimentary techniques with OpenCV and purely visual data (no cheating and reading game engine information).\n\nI plan to bring in deep learning in the coming tutorials to see just how far I can take this. \n\nThis series is not too much beginner-friendly, but I try my best to link to beginner friendly tutorials for the topics I do cover, and you can ask questions anywhere if you're confused. It's also not planned out, I am filming as I go, so I make no promises that the paths we take will lead anywhere at all :)...but I can promise at least a very dangerous self-driving scooter. \n\nAlong with the tutorials, I've started a github for the project, where other people can contribute ideas and improvements. \n\nFinally, it's not required you follow along with Grand Theft Auto V, any game where you drive and can clearly see lanes is do-able for a while at least until I am content with our self-driving car project and try something else in the game. The method we're using to see the screen (screen grabbing) and send input (direct input) should work on a huge list of games. \n\n**Video and text-based tutorials / code...etc:** [https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/)\n\n**Project's Github:** [https://github.com/sentdex/pygta5/](https://github.com/sentdex/pygta5/)",

How does your day-to-day work look like?\n\n----\n\n*edit:* Picking another job has come to mind already. But there are many other facets that are not in this post. General life stuff. Obligations, loans, family, ... I don't intend to take such a drastic route just yet. I also see this as a challenge. Developing in Windows *must* be somehow bearable. Yet I have tried many times, and always come back to Linux. I intend to give it another shot as Windows has come a long way in the past 10 years.\n\n----\n\nFirst, you should know that I currently work by SSHing into a development box and do all my work in vim, using tmux and pytest to have fast and always-visible unit-test executions.\n\nSo it's not *that* difficult to get work done. There are some coworkers however that don't have the proficiency in vim to stay productive like this.\n\nI myself would sometimes like to try some of those other fancy editors like Sublime or IDEs like pycharm. But as those need to be able to draw graphics/widgets I would neet to run them locally. SSHing with X-forwarding is just painfully slow. With a local Linux box, that's okay, but once we have to shift to new machines this will become more difficult.\n\nSome problems I have identified on Windows, are for example the handling of file permissions, new-line shenanigans, and most annoyingly, the handling of Python virtualenvs, installing of packages with C-extensions and whatnot.\n\nI was thinking about Vagrant of Docker, but can't quite find something comfortable to use. I think Vagrant has come closest so far. Docker has the problem that it runs inside a tiny VM, so linking local folders to the container is non-trivial... I have not yet managed to get it working.\n\nHow do your setups look like?",

After figuring out how to use Python bit I got Portable Python and sat myself down with the project of creating a 2 player game of Tic Tac Toe, *and I did.*\n\nI've never really done anything on this level with a computer before and I just feel like I've opened up a door to a whole new world! I feel *powerful* for what I've done and I can't wait to do more.\n\n[Here](http://pastebin.com/GrrEumWb) is my little program if you guys are interested in seeing what an awful newb's poorly documented code looks like. \n\nAnd happy coding to all! :D",

            "body": "I'm not sure how many people know about this, but since I just introduced it to a third person today, I thought it might be useful generally.\n\nOften I'll end up in a situation where I have a huge (like 6-10 GB) data file that's made up of lots of fixed-length structures, e.g.:\n\n    struct foo {\n        uint64_t x;\n        uint64_t y;\n        uint64_t z;\n        int32_t bar[256];\n    };\n\nNow, you could parse this in pure Python using struct:\n\n    import struct\n    fmt = \"<QQQ256i\"\n    sz = struct.calcsize(fmt)\n    f = open('bigfile.bin')\n    recs = []\n    while True:\n        data = f.read(sz)\n        if not data: break\n        recs.append(struct.unpack(fmt, data))\n\nBut for me this takes a long time for large files (around 2-3 minutes on a 6GB file) and it uses up a lot of memory to store a lot of Python objects (12G for that 6GB file).\n\nInstead you can use NumPy's support for reading structured arrays into a numpy array:\n\n    import numpy as np\n    f = open('bigfile.bin')\n    rectype = np.dtype( [ ('x', '<u8'), ('y', '<u8'),\n                          ('z', '<u8'), ('bar', '<i4', 256) ] )\n    recs = np.fromfile(f, dtype=rectype)\n\nWhich only takes 8 seconds on my machine, and uses only the 6GB of memory that data does on disk. Plus, you can make use of NumPy's excellent and fast array operations, like \"give me the average of the product of the x's and z's\": `np.mean(recs['x']*recs['z'])`.\n\nSo, if you need to do this kind of binary parsing, consider NumPy!",

            "body": "**namedtuple**\n\nI recently watched the most wonderful talk by  [Raymond Hettinger at Pycon 2015 about Pep8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M). Amongst many interesting and important points, he spoke about `namedtuple` that I believe he wrote. (It's toward the end of the talk at ~47:00). He posits that the namedtuple is one of the easiest ways to clean up your code and make it more readable.  It self-documents what is happening in the tuple.\n\nAnother advantage: Namedtuples instances are just as memory efficient as regular tuples as they do not have per-instance dictionaries, making them faster than dictionaries. \n\n\nHere's the code from his talk:\n\n    from collections import namedtuple\n    \n    Color = namedtuple('Color', ['hue', 'saturation', 'luminosity'])\n    \n     p = Color(170, 0.1, 0.6)\n     if p.saturation >= 0.5:\n         print \"Whew, that is bright!\"\n     if p.luminosity >= 0.5:\n         print \"Wow, that is light\"\n\nWithout naming each element in the tuple, it would read like this:\n\n    p = (170, 0.1, 0.6)\n    if p[1] >= 0.5:\n        print \"Whew, that is bright!\"\n    if p[2]>= 0.5:\n       print \"Wow, that is light\"\n\nIt is so much harder to understand what is going on in the first example.  With a namedtuple, each field has a name.  And you access it by name rather than position or index.  Instead of `p[1]`, we can call it `p.saturation`. It's easier to understand. And it looks cleaner.\n\nCreating an instance of the namedtuple is easier than creating a dictionary.\n\n    # dictionary\n    >>>p = dict(hue = 170, saturation = 0.1, luminosity = 0.6)\n    >>>p['hue']\n    170\n\n    #nametuple\n    >>>from collections import namedtuple\n    >>>Color = namedtuple('Color', ['hue', 'saturation', 'luminosity'])\n    >>>p = Color(170, 0.1, 0.6)\n    >>>p.hue\n    170\n\n**When might you use namedtuple**\n\nAs just stated, the namedtuple makes understanding tuples much easier. So if you need to reference the items in the tuple, then creating them as namedtuples just makes sense.\n\nBesides being more lightweight than a dictionary, namedtuple also keeps the order unlike the dictionary.\n\nAs in the example above, it is simpler to create an instance of namedtuple than dictionary. And referencing the item in the named tuple looks cleaner than a dictionary. `p.hue` rather than `p['hue']`.\n\n**The syntax**  \n\n`collections.namedtuple(typename, field_names[, verbose=False][, rename=False])`\n\n- namedtuple is in the `collections` library\n- `typename`: This is the name of the new tuple subclass.  \n- `field_names`: a sequence of names for each field. It can be a sequence as in a list `['x', 'y', 'z']` or string `x y z` (without commas, just whitespace) or `x, y, z`.\n- `rename`: If rename is `True`, invalid fieldnames are automatically replaced with positional names. For example, ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'abc'] is converted to ['abc', '_1', 'ghi', '_3'], eliminating the keyword 'def' (since that is a reserved word for defining functions) and the duplicate fieldname 'abc'.  \n- `verbose`: If verbose is `True`, the class definition is printed just before being built.\n\nYou can still access namedtuples by their position, if you so choose.\n`p[1] == p.saturation`\n\nIt still unpacks like a regular tuple.\n\n**Methods**  \nAll the [regular tuple methods](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq) are supported. Ex: min(), max(), len(), in, not in, concatenation (+), index, slice, etc. \n\nAnd there are a few additional ones for namedtuple.  Note: these all start with an underscore. `_replace`, `_make`, `_asdict`.\n\n-----\n`_replace`  \nReturns a new instance of the named tuple replacing specified fields with new values.\n\n**The syntax**  \n\n`somenamedtuple._replace(kwargs)`\n\n**Example**\n\n    >>>from collections import namedtuple\n    \n    >>>Color = namedtuple('Color', ['hue', 'saturation', 'luminosity'])\n    >>>p = Color(170, 0.1, 0.6)\n    \n    >>>p._replace(hue=87)\n    Color(87, 0.1, 0.6)\n    \n    >>>p._replace(hue=87, saturation=0.2)\n    Color(87, 0.2, 0.6)\n\n\n**Notice:** The field names are not in quotes; they are keywords here.   \n**Remember:** Tuples are immutable - even if they are namedtuples and have the `_replace` method.  The `_replace` produces a *new* instance; it does not modify the original or replace the old value. You can of course save the new result to the variable. `p = p._replace(hue=169)`\n\n----\n`_make`  \nMakes a new instance from an existing sequence or iterable.  \n\n**The syntax**\n\n`somenamedtuple._make(iterable)`\n\n**Example**\n\n     >>>data = (170, 0.1, 0.6)\n     >>>Color._make(data)\n    Color(hue=170, saturation=0.1, luminosity=0.6)\n    \n    >>>Color._make([170, 0.1, 0.6])  #the list is an iterable\n    Color(hue=170, saturation=0.1, luminosity=0.6)\n    \n    >>>Color._make((170, 0.1, 0.6))  #the tuple is an iterable\n    Color(hue=170, saturation=0.1, luminosity=0.6)\n    \n    >>>Color._make(170, 0.1, 0.6) \n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n        File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n        File \"<string>\", line 15, in _make\n    TypeError: 'float' object is not callable\n\nWhat happened with the last one? The item inside the parenthesis should be the iterable. So a list or tuple inside the parenthesis works, but the sequence of values without enclosing as an iterable returns an error.\n\n----\n`_asdict`  \n Returns a new [OrderedDict](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) which maps field names to their corresponding values.  \n\n **The syntax**\n\n `somenamedtuple._asdict()`\n\n **Example**\n\n     >>>p._asdict()\n    OrderedDict([('hue', 169), ('saturation', 0.1), ('luminosity', 0.6)])\n\n\n----\n\n\n[namedtuple in the docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple)\n\n",

I have access to the full edition, so I'll be able to use it to its full potential. I am wondering about a few things, though, as well as the general \"is it worth it?\" question.\n\n* How good is IdeaVim? I use spacemacs in Emacs, so I'm used to bopping around inside and between files with vim-style shortcuts.\n* Is there an easy way to sync settings between machines? I do development on 2-3 different computers (home, work, laptop), and I'd like to keep everything synced up between the three.\n* What are the killer features I should switch for?\n\nEDIT new question:\n\n* Is it possible to have machine-specific settings in addition to syncing general settings? For example, my laptop is super small, so I usually use a slightly smaller font size there so I can see a bit more code.\n* I also want to start using Python for more of my data analysis. Does Pycharm work well for that, or should I use a different package for the stats stuff?\n\nThanks y'all.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThank you all for the awesome advice and opinions. Since I have access to Pycharm Pro through the university I work for, I've decided that I'm going to give Pycharm a good long trial period to see if it can meet my needs.

Despite providing evidence from the Python Foundation on their open licensing (especially for my purposes, which is just local machine -- not production), they are still refusing on account that \"Python is type of GPL and it is interpretative.\"\n\nHave you guys run into something like this before? It seems ridiculous to me.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow -- this really blew up. Thanks for all of the responses.\n\nAfter additional prodding, I was told that the IT Standards team would \"look into it\" (code words for \"never\" probably). For clarification, yes, this is an enormous company and is rife with bureaucracy. Also, I am a developer working in a Windows environment.

            "body": "**Update: Seeing all the postings here: Thank you all in advance for your proposals!**\n\nFor the sake of easy installation of sources I used TkInter because it's the default. The background isn't interesting, but the question which GUI should a programmer chose is. \n\nThere isn't much documentation like a more systematic tutorial on TkInter on the net, but TkInter is easy anyway. This project is like others and grows in time. Since I'm working in automation and automation is based on windows only, but the Python community is somewhat centered around web technologies on Linux, I had always problems to find nice widgets to expand my programs.  For example I need a real time plotter with a horizontal time axis, which is easy to build with matplotlib, but this consumes on a i7 CPU 50% of the cycle with a cycle time of 100ms, when I have 600 data points. This is ridiculous, when I'm looking at some java script plotting elements. \n\nThe solution to present all my output on a webpage is still too time consuming too me, since I have to communicate with web sockets and fiddling with hatred java script. So I looked for DIY widgets and found TkInter3000, a library to make your own widgets. But the last version was for Python 2.6 and that means TkInter3000 is dead. I looked for wxpython, but the state of this library isn't much better. So it's looking like I have to choose between Qt and web technologies. \n\nQT as well as web pages are offering the opportunity using the SVG vector format, which makes the construction of gauges easier. I'm able to change properties of SVG objects with javascript, which is tempting. Qt as well as a small web server like Tornado is maintained. Tornado is really awesome, because Tornado is offering a seamless transition to websocket communication. \n\nSo Python's last real available GUI on Windows is Qt.  A programmer can use TkInter, but TkInter is somewhat limited and I wasn't aware enough. The Python Mega Widget 2.0 package for TkInter is working, but nevertheless I don't want to the risk to use a technology which is limited by heavy CPU usage, when it comes to a cyclic display of data. At least I shouldn't use matplotlib, which isn't made for this purpose\n\n\n",

            "body": "I'll just cut to the chase: run this program on CPython-2.7.2, and leave it running for a few minutes.\n\n    import subprocess\n    import threading\n    import random\n     \n    class Forkfuzz(threading.Thread):\n        def run(self):\n            while random.randint(0,100) > threading.active_count():\n                Forkfuzz().start()\n     \n            p = subprocess.Popen(['/bin/sleep', '1'])\n            p.communicate()\n     \n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        while True:\n            Forkfuzz().run()\n\nEventually, you'll see several Python child processes (not threads) sitting in a deadlocked state. Attach gdb to any of them, and you'll see a backtrace that looks like this:\n\n    #0  sem_wait () at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/sem_wait.S:86\n    #1  0x00000000004e02ad in PyThread_acquire_lock (lock=<value optimized out>, waitflag=<value optimized out>) at Python/thread_pthread.h:321\n    #2  0x00000000004e0447 in find_key (key=1, value=0x0) at Python/thread.c:268\n    #3  0x00000000004e053b in PyThread_get_key_value (key=38356064) at Python/thread.c:360\n    #4  0x00000000004cb2f8 in PyGILState_GetThisThreadState () at Python/pystate.c:598\n    #5  _PyGILState_Reinit () at Python/pystate.c:547\n    #6  0x00000000004e43f9 in PyOS_AfterFork () at ./Modules/signalmodule.c:979\n\nWhat's going on here is as follows. CPython uses a mutex, independent of the GIL, to control access to the structures that are used to implement [threading.local](http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html#threading.local). Any time a new Python thread starts up, it *very* briefly acquires this mutex in order to initialize its storage. Code called from PyOS_AfterFork() (which, as its name suggests, is responsible for doing various initialization right after a Python subprocess is forked off) also acquires this mutex; this code was introduced as part of the resolution for [issue 10517](http://bugs.python.org/issue10517). When you call fork() from a multithreaded program, the resulting child process is single-threaded; only the thread that called fork() gets copied over. Consequently, CPython-2.7.2 has a race condition: if one Python thread calls subprocess.Popen(), or anything else that forks off a subprocess, at the same time that another Python thread is initializing, and the fork occurs in the very narrow window in which the thread-local storage mutex is being held, then the resulting child process will be created with the mutex still held, and nothing to release it. Then, when PyOS_AfterFork() goes to acquire that mutex, it deadlocks.\n\nI maintain a piece of (in-house and proprietary) server software which runs on a very large network. Last month I updated it to run on python2.7, and this update was deployed to on-the-order-of one thousand servers. This bug cropped up on two servers out of those thousand. Luckily for my sanity, ops contacted me first rather than just restarting those servers, and I was able to grab a core image, see a backtrace like the one above, and eventually reproduce it with the above test case.\n\nThe kicker? CPython-2.7.3 reverted the issue 10517 patch, thereby fixing this bug by accident. ",

            "body": "I've noticed something very unusual! I'm running a simulation where I need to call `numpy.linalg.solve` thousands of times in sequence. I've verified with cProfile that this function call indeed consumes the vast majority of the runtime. \n\nSo my Mac runs `numpy.linalg.solve` a LOT faster than my desktop, despite the slower CPU. It's at LEAST 6 times faster and I'm trying to figure out why that is. I also checked using the `top` command that the CPU utilization floats around 250% on the mac, and is a constant 100% on Linux.\n\nHere are the specs on the CPU's:\n\nMac CPU:\n\n* i7-4750HQ @ 4 * 2000 MHz (supports Hyper-threading)\n* Numpy 1.9.3 on Python 3.5.1\n* Mac OS 10.11.3\n\nDesktop CPU: \n\n* i5-2400 @ 4 * 3400 MHz\n* Numpy 1.10.4 on Python 3.5.1\n* Arch Linux 4.4.1-2\n\nI installed numpy and scipy by using the pip package manager on both systems.\n\nDoes anyone have a clue?\n\n\n\n**UPDATE: Thanks everybody, problem SOLVED! Here's how:**\n\nI managed to get the desktop's i5 to perform almost as fast as the Mac's i7. It's about 20% slower, which is entirely what you'd expect when looking at CPU benchmarks.\n\nFirst, some important facts:\n\n* The Mac's i7 is actually noticeably [faster](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_lookup.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-4750HQ+%40+2.00GHz&id=1957) than the Desktop's i5, as /u/xXxDeAThANgEL99xXx pointed out.\n* Mac's come with a highly optimized BLAS library, as /u/thatguydr pointed out.\n* When you install `numpy` using `pip`, it doesn't handle library dependencies outside of the Python packages. So when you don't have fast linear algebra libraries installed, it will revert to something slow AFAIK.\n\nI proceeded by installing a precompiled version of ATLAS using Arch's package manager `pacman`, which resulted in a significant improvement but it was still 2-3 times slower than the Mac.\n\nNext, I compiled ATLAS from source (which is surprisingly easy when you figure out how to disable CPU throttling) by downloading it from the `AUR`.\n\nThis is a *very* important step because it's the only way to introduce platform and CPU specific optimizations, hence the name ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software).\n\nSo at the end of the day the i5 is still slower than the Mac's i7, but only by about 20%, which is normal.",

I'd say 90% of the time it works all of the time. \n\nI am still refining it here and there so it's not 100% perfect. But some of the results so far have been pretty funny/neat so I thought I would share my progress with you all. \n\n\nI think some of the best one's are for the /r/whatsthis* subreddits because the resulting image is often a picture of a weird bug/plant/bird and a description of what it is. \n\nIn the future I think I'm going to try and integrate this with imgur's API and have it run once daily against 1 or 2 subreddits and then upload the results to an album on imgur so that I can look through them when I'm bored. \n\nI've run it against a number of popular subreddits and a limited number of their top posts from all-time.

So, one of the features of my project is a cross-reference showing how every operation can be done in BOTH R and Python.\n\nI've also included some files with objectives (stuff like, join transactions to users), but without the answers so you can try to fill this out like it's a practice worksheet.\n\nLastly, some notes:\n\n* I'm using data.table version 1.9.7 (very soon to be 1.9.8 - I spoke with the developers). It has a few nifty features not in data.table 1.9.6 which is the current version on CRAN\n* I left some of the python objectives blank.

            "body": "I'm trying to make the switch from C# to Python as my \"goto\" language as it gives me a bit more flexibility. One thing I'm giving up though is rapid GUI development. I like how I can just open Visual Studio, click and drag a few controls, double click them and start writing code. From my Python experience so far, this seems quite cumbersome. I don't necessarily need a drag and drop GUI equivalent... my previous GUI experience before C# has been programmatically generating GUIs so I'm quite comfortable with that. But even then, Python seems less than ideal. \n\nHere are my assumptions so far, please correct me if I'm wrong and hopefully provide some corrections:\n\n* PyQt has a GUI designer but it's decoupled from your Python IDE... so you need to switch between applications and run some 'c++ to python' scripts/apps.\n* PyQt GUIs can be created programmatically... but PyQt isn't \"free\"\n* PySide is a good alternative but it seems to be dead for PyQt5 (Source: http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide)\n* wxPython doesn't support Python 3 (this just seems crazy to me)\n* ProjectPhoenix has converted wxPython to Python 3 but I feel like I'm backing the wrong horse by using it\n* PyGTK and TKinter don't seem to have much fan-fare which makes me hesitant to use it.\n\nMy preference would probably be wxPython but as it doesn't support Python 3 I think that really only leaves TKinter and PyGTK... seeing as TKinter is built into Python then that seems like the logical choice.\n\n\nAside from all that, I have considered just writing \"standalone\" web apps where I provide a batch/script file which launches a local web server followed by a web browser which connects to the web server. Seems a bit clunky but having done web development for a few years I'm pretty comfortable creating web GUIs compared to desktop GUIs.\n\n\nI guess my question is... what's everyone else doing?\n\n\nCheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I had a little Python knowledge going in, but no computer science background. (For instance, I knew how to use a dictionary, but had no idea that dictionaries work well because they use hash tables). Udacity promised to teach me to build a search engine in seven weeks, and sure enough, [I did](http://davedavefind.appspot.com/)! I'm entering [this very simple search engine](http://davedavefind.appspot.com/), which searches the course materials, forum, and videos, in an end-of-class contest.\n\nWe never actually implemented the search engine code we wrote in class, but I did learn the basics of how a crawler, graph, and index work. More important, I learned a lot about how to solve big programming problems from the Udacity format of short videos plus immediate experimentation. I'm amazed that I got this project to work, but it was really just a matter of breaking big problems into small steps, reading documentation, and asking for help when I got stuck.\n\nI'm excited for the next courses, impressed at how much I learned, and optimistic about new models for online education. The next [round of classes](http://www.udacity.com/) (all using Python) start today, so I thought I'd post this here and encourage anyone interested in learning to build their own to sign up.",
